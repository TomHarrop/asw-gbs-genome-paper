The speed and bandwidth efficiency of the new parallel implementation have also been substantially improved, allowing the assembly of a human genome to be accomplished in 24 hours on the JGI/NERSC Genepool system. To highlight the features of Meraculous2 we present here the assembly of the diploid human genome NA12878, and compare it with previously published assemblies of the same data using other algorithms. The Meraculous2 assemblies are shown to have better completeness, contiguity, and accuracy than other published assemblies for these data. Practical considerations including pre-assembly analyses of polymorphism and repetitiveness are described.},

  abstract = {We describe a new algorithm, meraculous, for whole genome assembly of deep paired-end short reads, and apply it to the assembly of a dataset of paired 75-bp Illumina reads derived from the 15.4 megabase genome of the haploid yeast Pichia stipitis. More than 95\% of the genome is recovered, with no errors; half the assembled sequence is in contigs longer than 101 kilobases and in scaffolds longer than 269 kilobases. Incorporating fosmid ends recovers entire chromosomes. Meraculous relies on an efficient and conservative traversal of the subgraph of the k-mer (deBruijn) graph of oligonucleotides with unique high quality extensions in the dataset, avoiding an explicit error correction step as used in other short-read assemblers. A novel memory-efficient hashing scheme is introduced. The resulting contigs are ordered and oriented using paired reads separated by {$\sim$}280 bp or {$\sim$}3.2 kbp, and many gaps between contigs can be closed using paired-end placements. Practical issues with the dataset are described, and prospects for assembling larger genomes are discussed.},

  abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

  abstract = {While many short read assemblers attempt to simplify the de Brujin graph by identifying and resolving variant-induced bubbles to produce a haploid mosaic result, this approach is only viable when variants are relatively rare and the bubbles are well defined in a graph context. We observed that diploid genomes with very high levels of heterozygosity fail to display well-resolved bubble structures in a typical assembly graph and thus result in highly fragmented and incomplete assemblies. Here we present an enhancement of Meraculous2 algorithm, called Meraculous-2D, which preserves haplotypes across variant sites and generates accurate assembly of highly heterozygous diploid genomes. Preserving and taking advantage of the allelic variation throughout the assembly process allows reconstructing both haplomes at once, without the need to pick arbitrary paths through bubble structures. We also enhanced the original diploidy resolution method of Meraculous2 to maintain and report phased haplotype variant information.},

This method is applicable for whole-genome sequences of hundreds of individuals. Using extensive simulation, we demonstrate the usefulness of the method for inferring demographic history, especially recent changes in population size. We apply the method to the whole-genome sequence data of 9 populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and show a pattern of fluctuations in human populations from 10,000 to 200,000 years ago.},
