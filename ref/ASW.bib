  abstract = {Here we present Singularity, software developed to bring containers and reproducibility to scientific computing. Using Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible environments of their choosing and design, and these complete environments can easily be copied and executed on other platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and compute environments. This ability to create and deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing development for computational science.},

  abstract = {Inferring demographic history is an important task in population genetics. Many existing inference methods are based on predefined simplified population models, which are more suitable for hypothesis testing than exploratory analysis. We developed a novel model-flexible method called stairway plot, which infers changes in population size over time using SNP frequency spectra. This method is applicable for whole-genome sequences of hundreds of individuals. Using extensive simulation, we demonstrate the usefulness of the method for inferring demographic history, especially recent changes in population size. We apply the method to the whole-genome sequence data of 9 populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and show a pattern of fluctuations in human populations from 10,000 to 200,000 years ago.},

  abstract = {The order Coleoptera (beetles) is arguably the most species-rich lineage of animals. Beetles exhibit an extraordinary variety of life histories and occupy most terrestrial environments. Whole genome sequences are available for 11 beetle species, only six of which have been published. Studies of beetle genomes have revealed remarkable new insights into the genomic basis and evolution of beetle life histories and other aspects of beetle biodiversity, including the genes underlying chemoperception, detoxification, and specialized plant feeding, as well as the role of horizontal gene transfer in elaboration of the beetle trophic repertoire. Nonetheless, such studies are in their infancy. The study of beetle genomes has the potential to further revolutionize our understanding of beetle biodiversity, but genomic studies of beetles remain seriously limited in scope and resolution by the very few genomes that are currently available for study.},

However, assembly of highly heterozygous genomes is still problematic when regional heterogeneity is so high that haplotype homology is not recognised during assembly. This results in regional duplication rather than consolidation into allelic variants and can cause issues with downstream analysis, for example variant discovery, or haplotype reconstruction using the diploid assembly with unpaired allelic contigs.},
