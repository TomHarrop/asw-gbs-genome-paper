    Declines in honey bee health have been attributed to multiple interacting
    environmental stressors; among the most important are forage/nutrition
    deficits and parasites and pathogens. Recent studies suggest poor honey bee
    nutrition can exacerbate the negative impacts of infectious viral and fungal
    diseases, and conversely, that common honey bee parasites and pathogens can
    adversely affect bee nutritional physiology. This sets up the potential for
    harmful feedbacks between poor nutrition and infectious disease that may
    contribute to spiraling declines in bee health. We suggest that improving
    bees’ nutritional resilience should be a major goal in combating challenges
    to bee health; this approach can buffer bees from other environmental
    stressors such as pathogen infection.

    BACKGROUND:Rice, Oryza sativa L., is the staple food for half the world's
    population. By 2030, the production of rice must increase by at least 25% in
    order to keep up with global population growth and demand. Accelerated
    genetic gains in rice improvement are needed to mitigate the effects of
    climate change and loss of arable land, as well as to ensure a stable global
    food supply. FINDINGS:We resequenced a core collection of 3,000 rice
    accessions from 89 countries. All 3,000 genomes had an average sequencing
    depth of 14×, with average genome coverages and mapping rates of 94.0% and
    92.5%, respectively. From our sequencing efforts, approximately 18.9 million
    single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rice were discovered when aligned
    to the reference genome of the temperate japonica variety, Nipponbare.
    Phylogenetic analyses based on SNP data confirmed differentiation of the O.
    sativa gene pool into 5 varietal groups - indica, aus/boro, basmati/sadri,
    tropical japonica and temperate japonica. CONCLUSIONS:Here, we report an
    international resequencing effort of 3,000 rice genomes. This data serves as
    a foundation for large-scale discovery of novel alleles for important rice
    phenotypes using various bioinformatics and/or genetic approaches. It also
    serves to understand the genomic diversity within O. sativa at a higher
    level of detail. With the release of the sequencing data, the project calls
    for the global rice community to take advantage of this data as a foundation
    for establishing a global, public rice genetic/genomic database and
    information platform for advancing rice breeding technology for future rice
    improvement.

    In order to understand how the morphology of plant species has diversified
    over time, it is necessary to decipher how the underlying developmental
    programs have evolved. The regulatory network controlling shoot meristem
    activity is likely to have played an important role in morphological
    diversification and useful insights can be gained by comparing monocots and
    eudicots. These two distinct monophyletic groups of angiosperms diverged 130
    Ma and are characterized by important differences in their morphology.
    Several studies of eudicot species have revealed a conserved role for NAM
    and CUC3 genes in meristem functioning and pattern formation through the
    definition of morphogenetic boundaries during development. In this study, we
    show that NAM- and CUC3-related genes are conserved in palms and grasses,
    their diversification having predated the radiation of monocots and
    eudicots. Moreover, the NAM-miR164 posttranscriptional regulatory module is
    also conserved in palm species. However, in contrast to the CUC3-related
    genes, which share a similar expression pattern between the two angiosperm
    groups, the expression domain of the NAM-miR164 module differs between
    monocot and eudicot species. In our studies of spatial expression patterns,
    we compared existing eudicot data with novel results from our work using two
    palm species (date palm and oil palm) and two members of the Poaceae (rice
    and millet). In addition to contrasting results obtained at the gene
    expression level, major differences were also observed between eudicot and
    monocot NAM-related genes in the occurrence of putative cis-regulatory
    elements in their promoter sequences. Overall, our results suggest that
    although NAM- and CUC3-related proteins are functionally equivalent between
    monocots and eudicots, evolutionary radiation has resulted in heterotopy
    through alterations in the expression domain of the NAM-miR164 regulatory
    module.

    The fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied
    organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of
    many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes,
    including humans. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all
    of the similar to 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the Drosophila genome
    using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive
    clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome
    physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however,
    the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and Contiguity to be declared
    substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome
    structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The genome
    encodes similar to 13,600 genes, somewhat fewer than the smaller
    Caenorhabditis elegans genome, but with comparable functional diversity.

    RNA-seq is an effective method for studying the transcriptome, but it can be
    difficult to apply to scarce or degraded RNA from fixed clinical samples,
    rare cell populations or cadavers. Recent studies have proposed several
    methods for RNA-seq of low-quality and/or low-quantity samples, but the
    relative merits of these methods have not been systematically analyzed. Here
    we compare five such methods using metrics relevant to transcriptome
    annotation, transcript discovery and gene expression. Using a single human
    RNA sample, we constructed and sequenced ten libraries with these methods
    and compared them against two control libraries. We found that the RNase H
    method performed best for chemically fragmented, low-quality RNA, and we
    confirmed this through analysis of actual degraded samples. RNase H can even
    effectively replace oligo(dT)-based methods for standard RNA-seq. SMART and
    NuGEN had distinct strengths for measuring low-quantity RNA. Our analysis
    allows biologists to select the most suitable methods and provides a
    benchmark for future method development.

    Background

    Evidence in yeast indicates that gene expression is correlated with
    recombination activity and double-strand break (DSB) formation in some
    hotspots. Studies of nucleosome occupancy in yeast and mice also suggest
    that open chromatin influences the formation of DSBs. In Drosophila
    melanogaster, high-resolution recombination maps show an excess of DSBs
    within annotated transcripts relative to intergenic sequences. The impact of
    active transcription on recombination landscapes, however, remains
    unexplored in a multicellular organism. We then investigated the
    transcription profile during early meiosis in D. melanogaster females to
    obtain a glimpse at the relevant transcriptional dynamics during DSB
    formation, and test the specific hypothesis that DSBs preferentially target
    transcriptionally active genomic regions.


    Results

    Our study of transcript profiles of early- and late-meiosis using mRNA-seq
    revealed, 1) significant differences in gene expression, 2) new genes and
    exons, 3) parent-of-origin effects on transcription in early-meiosis stages,
    and 4) a nonrandom genomic distribution of transcribed genes. Importantly,
    genomic regions that are more actively transcribed during early meiosis show
    higher rates of recombination, and we ruled out DSB preference for genic
    regions that are not transcribed.


    Conclusions

    Our results provide evidence in a multicellular organism that transcription
    during the initial phases of meiosis increases the likelihood of DSB and
    give insight into the molecular determinants of recombination rate variation
    across the D. melanogaster genome. We propose that a model where variation
    in gene expression plays a role altering the recombination landscape across
    the genome could provide a molecular, heritable and plastic mechanism to
    observed patterns of recombination variation, from the high level of
    intra-specific variation to the known influence of environmental factors and
    stress conditions.

    factors (TFs) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These were
    identified from a list of candidate proteins with transcription-related Gene
    Ontology (Go) annotation as well as structural DNA-binding domain
    assignments. For all 1052 candidate proteins, a defined set of rules was
    applied to classify information from the literature and computational data
    sources with respect to both DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory
    properties. We propose a set of 753 TFs in the fruit fly, of which 23 are
    confident novel predictions of this function for previously uncharacterized
    proteins.

    Morphogens have been linked to numerous developmental processes, including
    organ patterning and the control of organ size. Here we review how different
    experimental approaches have led to an unprecedented level of molecular
    knowledge about the patterning role of the Drosophila melanogaster morphogen
    Decapentaplegic (DPP, the homologue of vertebrate bone morphogenetic
    protein, or BMP), the first validated secreted morphogen. In addition, we
    discuss how little is known about the role of the DPP morphogen in the
    control of organ growth and organ size. Continued efforts to elucidate the
    role of DPP in D. melanogaster is likely to shed light on this fundamental
    question in the near future.

    We discuss on the relative significance of different functional roles
    potentially served by flavonoids in photoprotection, with special emphasis
    to their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and control the
    development of individual organs and whole plant. We propose a model in
    which chloroplast-located flavonoids scavenge H2O2 and singlet oxygen
    generated under excess light-stress, thus avoiding programmed cell death. We
    also draw a picture in which vacuolar flavonoids in conjunction with
    peroxidases and ascorbic acid constitute a secondary antioxidant system
    aimed at detoxifying H2O2, which may diffuse out of the chloroplast at
    considerable rates and enter the vacuole following excess light
    stress-induced depletion of ascorbate peroxidase. We hypothesize for
    flavonols key roles as developmental regulators in early and current-day
    land-plants, based on their ability to modulate auxin movement and auxin
    catabolism. We show that antioxidant flavonoids display the greatest
    capacity to regulate key steps of cell growth and differentiation in
    eukaryotes. These regulatory functions of flavonoids, which are shared by
    plants and animals, are fully accomplished in the nM concentration range, as
    likely occurred in early land plants. We therefore conclude that functions
    of flavonoids as antioxidants and/or developmental regulators flavonoids are
    of great value in photoprotection. We also suggest that UV-B screening was
    just one of the multiple functions served by flavonoids when early
    land-plants faced an abrupt increase in sunlight irradiance.

  abstract: >-
    Rapid progress in studies on flower development has resulted in refining the
    classical 'ABC model' into a new 'ABCDE model' to explain properly the
    regulation of floral organ identity. Conservation of E-function for flower
    organ identity among the dicotyledonous (dicot) plants has been revealed.
    However, its conservation in monocotyledonous (monocot) plants remains
    largely unknown. Here, we show the conservation of E-function in rice (Oryza
    sativaL.) by characterizing tissue culture-induced mutants of two MADS-box
    genes, OsMADS1and OsMADS5, which form a subclade within the well-supported
    clade of SEP-genes (E-function) phylogeny. Severe loss-of-function mutations
    of OsMADS1cause complete homeotic conversion of organs (lodicules, stamens,
    and carpels) of three inner whorls into lemma- and palea-like structures.
    Such basic deformed structure is reiterated along with the pedicel at the
    center of the same floret, indicating the loss of determinacy of the flower
    meristem. These phenotypes resemble the phenotypes caused by mutations of
    the dicot E-class genes, such as the Arabidopsis SEP123(SEPALLATA1/2/3) and
    the petunia FBP2(Floral Binding Protein 2), suggesting that OsMADS1play a
    very similar role in rice to that of defined E-class genes in dicot plants.
    In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either
    panicles or vegetative organs was observed. These results demonstrate that
    OsMADS1clearly possesses E-function, and so, E-function is fundamentally
    conserved between dicot plants and rice, a monocot model plant.

    Despite the ever-increasing output of Illumina sequencing data, loci with
    extreme base compositions are often under-represented or absent. To evaluate
    sources of base-composition bias, we traced genomic sequences ranging from
    6% to 90% GC through the process by quantitative PCR. We identified PCR
    during library preparation as a principal source of bias and optimized the
    conditions. Our improved protocol significantly reduces amplification bias
    and minimizes the previously severe effects of PCR instrument and
    temperature ramp rate.

    The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time
    series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the
    hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for
    statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood
    estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information
    theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the
    purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several
    competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum
    likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined
    by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted
    parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for
    statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent
    in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The
    practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some
    numerical examples.

    BACKGROUND:In crops, inflorescence complexity and the shape and size of the
    seed are among the most important characters that influence yield. For
    example, rice panicles vary considerably in the number and order of
    branches, elongation of the axis, and the shape and size of the seed. Manual
    low-throughput phenotyping methods are time consuming, and the results are
    unreliable. However, high-throughput image analysis of the qualitative and
    quantitative traits of rice panicles is essential for understanding the
    diversity of the panicle as well as for breeding programs. RESULTS:This
    paper presents P-TRAP software (Panicle TRAit Phenotyping), a free open
    source application for high-throughput measurements of panicle architecture
    and seed-related traits. The software is written in Java and can be used
    with different platforms (the user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    uses Netbeans Platform 7.3). The application offers three main tools: a tool
    for the analysis of panicle structure, a spikelet/grain counting tool, and a
    tool for the analysis of seed shape. The three tools can be used
    independently or simultaneously for analysis of the same image. Results are
    then reported in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Comma Separated
    Values (CSV) file formats. Images of rice panicles were used to evaluate the
    efficiency and robustness of the software. Compared to data obtained by
    manual processing, P-TRAP produced reliable results in a much shorter time.
    In addition, manual processing is not repeatable because dry panicles are
    vulnerable to damage. The software is very useful, practical and collects
    much more data than human operators. CONCLUSIONS:P-TRAP is a new open source
    software that automatically recognizes the structure of a panicle and the
    seeds on the panicle in numeric images. The software processes and
    quantifies several traits related to panicle structure, detects and counts
    the grains, and measures their shape parameters. In short, P-TRAP offers
    both efficient results and a user-friendly environment for experiments. The
    experimental results showed very good accuracy compared to field operator,
    expert verification and well-known academic methods.

    BACKGROUND:Metatranscriptomics is rapidly expanding our knowledge of gene
    expression patterns and pathway dynamics in natural microbial communities.
    However, to cope with the challenges of environmental sampling, various rRNA
    removal and cDNA synthesis methods have been applied in published microbial
    metatranscriptomic studies, making comparisons arduous. Whereas efficiency
    and biases introduced by rRNA removal methods have been relatively well
    explored, the impact of cDNA synthesis and library preparation on transcript
    abundance remains poorly characterized. The evaluation of potential biases
    introduced at this step is challenging for metatranscriptomic samples, where
    data analyses are complex, for example because of the lack of reference
    genomes. RESULTS:Herein, we tested four cDNA synthesis and Illumina library
    preparation protocols on a simplified mixture of total RNA extracted from
    four bacterial species. In parallel, RNA from each microbe was tested
    individually. cDNA synthesis was performed on rRNA depleted samples using
    the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Preparation, the SMARTer Stranded
    RNA-Seq, or the Ovation RNA-Seq V2 System. A fourth experiment was made
    directly from total RNA using the Encore Complete Prokaryotic RNA-Seq. The
    obtained sequencing data were analyzed for: library complexity and
    reproducibility; rRNA removal efficiency and bias; the number of genes
    detected; coverage uniformity; and the impact of protocols on expression
    biases. Significant variations, especially in organism representation and
    gene expression patterns, were observed among the four methods. TruSeq
    generally performed best, but is limited by its requirement of hundreds of
    nanograms of total RNA. The SMARTer method appears the best solution for
    smaller amounts of input RNA. For very low amounts of RNA, the Ovation
    System provides the only option; however, the observed biases emphasized its
    limitations for quantitative analyses. CONCLUSIONS:cDNA and library
    preparation methods may affect the outcome and interpretation of
    metatranscriptomic data. The most appropriate method should be chosen based
    on the available quantity of input RNA and the quantitative or
    non-quantitative objectives of the study. When low amounts of RNA are
    available, as in most metatranscriptomic studies, the SMARTer method seems
    to be the best compromise to obtain reliable results. This study emphasized
    the difficulty in comparing metatranscriptomic studies performed using
    different methods.

  abstract: >-
    MOTIVATION:The complete sequencing of many genomes has made it possible to
    identify orthologous genes descending from a common ancestor. However,
    reconstruction of evolutionary history over long time periods faces many
    challenges due to gene duplications and losses. Identification of
    orthologous groups shared by multiple proteomes therefore becomes a
    clustering problem in which an optimal compromise between conflicting
    evidences needs to be found. RESULTS:Here we present a new proteome-scale
    analysis program called MultiParanoid that can automatically find orthology
    relationships between proteins in multiple proteomes. The software is an
    extension of the InParanoid program that identifies orthologs and inparalogs
    in pairwise proteome comparisons. MultiParanoid applies a clustering
    algorithm to merge multiple pairwise ortholog groups from InParanoid into
    multi-species ortholog groups. To avoid outparalogs in the same cluster,
    MultiParanoid only combines species that share the same last ancestor. To
    validate the clustering technique, we compared the results to a reference
    set obtained by manual phylogenetic analysis. We further compared the
    results to ortholog groups in KOGs and OrthoMCL, which revealed that
    MultiParanoid produces substantially fewer outparalogs than these resources.
    AVAILABILITY:MultiParanoid is a freely available standalone program that
    enables efficient orthology analysis much needed in the post-genomic era. A
    web-based service providing access to the original datasets, the resulting
    groups of orthologs, and the source code of the program can be found at
    http://multiparanoid.cgb.ki.se.

    Supernumerary chromosomes are widespread in the plant kingdom but little is
    known of their molecular nature or mechanism of origin. We report here the
    initial cloning of sequences from the maize B chromosome. Our analysis
    suggests that many sequences are highly repetitive and shared with the
    normal A chromosomes. However, all clones selected for B-specificity contain
    at least one copy of a particular repeat. Cytological mapping using B
    chromosome derivatives and in situ hybridization show that the B specific
    repeats are derived from the centric region of the chromosome. Sequence
    analysis of this repeat shows homology to motifs mapped to various plant and
    animal centromeres and to the maize neocentromere. A precise localization of
    these sequences among breakpoints within the B centromere and an homology to
    a facultative centromere, suggest a role for this sequence in centromere
    function.

    Reduction in nutrient intake without malnutrition can delay ageing and

    intervention into human ageing and age-related diseases. Here we review the
    current knowledge of the interactions between nutrient signalling pathways

    The vertebrate nuclear hormone receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1; NR5A1)
    controls reproductive development and regulates the transcription of
    steroid-modifying cytochrome P450 genes. We find that the SF1-related
    Drosophila nuclear hormone receptor HR39 is also essential for sexual
    development. In Hr39 mutant females, the sperm-storing spermathecae and
    glandular parovaria are absent or defective, causing sterility. Our results
    indicate that spermathecae and parovaria secrete reproductive tract proteins
    required for sperm maturation and function, like the mammalian epididymis
    and female reproductive tract. Hr39 controls the expression of specific
    cytochrome P450 genes and is required in females both to activate
    spermathecal secretion and repress male-specific courtship genes such as
    takeout. Thus, a pathway that, in vertebrates, controls sex-specific steroid
    hormone production, also mediates reproductive functions in an invertebrate.
    Our findings suggest that Drosophila can be used to model more aspects of
    mammalian reproductive biology than previously believed.

  abstract: >-
    The ABC model postulates that expression combinations of three classes of
    genes (A, B and C) specify the four floral organs at early stages of flower
    development. This classic model provides a solid framework to study flower
    development and has been the foundation for multiple studies in different
    plant species, as well as for new evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, it
    has been shown that in spite of being necessary, these three gene classes
    are not sufficient for flower organ specification. Rather, flower organ
    specification depends on complex interactions of several genes, and probably
    other non-genetic factors. Being useful to study systems of complex
    interactions, mathematical and computational models have enlightened the
    origin of the A, B and C stereotyped and robust expression patterns and the
    process of early flower morphogenesis. Here, we present a brief introduction
    to basic modeling concepts and techniques and review the results that these
    models have rendered for the particular case of the Arabidopsis thaliana
    flower organ specification. One of the main results is the uncovering of a
    robust functional module that is sufficient to recover the gene
    configurations characterizing flower organ primordia. Another key result is
    that the temporal sequence with which such gene configurations are attained
    may be recovered only by modeling the aforementioned functional module as a
    noisy or stochastic system. Finally, modeling approaches enable testable
    predictions regarding the role of non-genetic factors (noise,
    mechano-elastic forces, etc.) in development. These predictions, along with
    some perspectives for future work, are also reviewed and discussed.

  abstract: >-
    In contrast to the classical view of development as a preprogrammed and
    deterministic process, recent studies have demonstrated that stochastic
    perturbations of highly non-linear systems may underlie the emergence and
    stability of biological patterns. Herein, we address the question of whether
    noise contributes to the generation of the stereotypical temporal pattern in
    gene expression during flower development. We modeled the regulatory network
    of organ identity genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana flower as a stochastic
    system. This network has previously been shown to converge to ten
    fixed-point attractors, each with gene expression arrays that characterize
    inflorescence cells and primordial cells of sepals, petals, stamens, and
    carpels. The network used is binary, and the logical rules that govern its
    dynamics are grounded in experimental evidence. We introduced different
    levels of uncertainty in the updating rules of the network. Interestingly,
    for a level of noise of around 0.5-10%, the system exhibited a sequence of
    transitions among attractors that mimics the sequence of gene activation
    configurations observed in real flowers. We also implemented the gene
    regulatory network as a continuous system using the Glass model of
    differential equations, that can be considered as a first approximation of
    kinetic-reaction equations, but which are not necessarily equivalent to the
    Boolean model. Interestingly, the Glass dynamics recover a temporal sequence
    of attractors, that is qualitatively similar, although not identical, to
    that obtained using the Boolean model. Thus, time ordering in the emergence
    of cell-fate patterns is not an artifact of synchronous updating in the
    Boolean model. Therefore, our model provides a novel explanation for the
    emergence and robustness of the ubiquitous temporal pattern of floral organ
    specification. It also constitutes a new approach to understanding
    morphogenesis, providing predictions on the population dynamics of cells
    with different genetic configurations during development.

    Skip to Next Section

    Formation of the Drosophila embryonic termini is controlled by the localized
    activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Torso. Both Torso and Torso's
    presumed ligand, Trunk, are expressed uniformly in the early embryo. Polar
    activation of Torso requires Torso-like, which is expressed by follicle
    cells adjacent to the ends of the developing oocyte. We find that Torso
    expressed at high levels in cultured Drosophila cells is activated by
    individual application of Trunk, Torso-like or another known Torso ligand,
    Prothoracicotropic Hormone. In addition to assays of downstream signaling
    activity, Torso dimerization was detected using bimolecular fluorescence
    complementation. Trunk and Torso-like were active when co-transfected with
    Torso and when presented to Torso-expressing cells in conditioned medium.
    Trunk and Torso-like were also taken up from conditioned medium specifically
    by cells expressing Torso. At low levels of Torso, similar to those present
    in the embryo, Trunk and Torso-like alone were ineffective but acted
    synergistically to stimulate Torso signaling. Our results suggest that Torso
    interacts with both Trunk and Torso-like, which cooperate to mediate
    dimerization and activation of Torso at the ends of the Drosophila embryo.

    Transcriptome sequencing allows for analysis of mature RNAs at base pair
    resolution. Here we show that RNA-seq can also be used for studying nascent
    RNAs undergoing transcription. We sequenced total RNA from human brain and
    liver and found a large fraction of reads (up to 40%) within introns.
    Intronic RNAs were abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved
    in axonal growth and synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected
    significant differences in intronic RNA levels between fetal and adult
    brains. We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is
    explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional
    splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing indicates a
    correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing. Our
    data show that sequencing of total RNA provides unique insight into the
    transcriptional processes in the cell, with particular importance for normal
    brain development.

    Three point mutations R335S, L336V and V476L, distinguish the sequence of a
    cytochrome P450 CYP6A2 variant assumed to be responsible for
    1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(4'-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) resistance in the
    RDDTR strain of Drosophila melanogaster. To determine the impact of each
    mutation on the function of CYP6A2, the wild-type enzyme (CYP6A2wt) of
    Cyp6a2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as well as three variants carrying
    a single mutation, the double mutant CYP6A2vSV and the triple mutant
    CYP6A2vSVL. All CYP6A2 variants were less stable than the CYP6A2wt protein.
    Two activities enhanced in the RDDTR strain were measured with all
    recombinant proteins, namely testosterone hydroxylation and DDT metabolism.
    Testosterone was hydroxylated at the 2beta position with little quantitative
    variation among the variants. In contrast, metabolism of DDT was strongly
    affected by the mutations. The CYP6A2vSVL enzyme had an enhanced metabolism
    of DDT, producing dicofol, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane and
    dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid. The apparent affinity of the enzymes CYP6A2wt
    and CYP6A2vSVL for DDT and testosterone was not significantly different as
    revealed by the type I difference spectra. Sequence alignments with CYP102A1
    provided clues to the positions of the amino acids mutated in CYP6A2. These
    mutations were found spatially clustered in the vicinity of the distal end
    of helix I relative to the substrate recognition valley. Thus this area,
    including helix J, is important for the structure and activity of CYP6A2.
    Furthermore, we show here that point mutations in a cytochrome P450 can have
    a prominent role in insecticide resistance.

    The concept of organic fanning is summarised and compared as an example to
    farming with biotechnology-derived crops. If done within an ecological
    concept, both methods can be seen as environmentally acceptable. Organic
    farming does not offer consistent arguments for the rejection of transgenic
    crops. Some arguments (from genomics to biodiversity) are discussed in order
    to demonstrate that the contrast between both fanning systems is rated too
    high and that it is possible to overcome the divide. In this way the ground
    is prepared for a proposal on how to merge those otherwise incompatible
    agricultural management systems, a proposal that also will have to build on
    a new concept of sustainability. It will be dealt with in the second part of
    the article in the next issue of New Biotechnology.

    In the previous article [Ammann, K. (2008) Feature: integrated farming: why
    organic farmers should use transgenic crops. New Biotechnol. 25, 101-107],
    in a plea for the introduction of transgenic crops into organic and
    integrated farming, it was announced that the complementary topic, namely
    that high tech farmers should integrate elements of organic agriculture,
    will be a follow up. Some selected arguments for such a view are summarised
    here. Basically, they comprise a differentiated view on agro-biodiversity
    outside the field of production; landscape management methods to enhance
    biodiversity levels. Both elements are compatible with basic ideas of
    organic farming. First, Precision Farming is given as one example of the
    many ways to support agricultural production through high technology, with
    the aim of reducing energy input, maintaining excellent soil conditions and
    enhancing yield. It is clear from this analysis that modern agriculture and
    certain elements of organic-integrated agriculture are compatible. There are
    sectors of high tech farming, such as the introduction of a better recycling
    scheme and also a better focus on socio-economic aspects, which need to be
    taken up seriously from organic-integrated farming, a system which puts a
    lot of emphasis on those elements and for which important research data are
    available. In the final part a new concept of dynamic sustainability is
    presented.

    RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other
    forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of
    these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential
    isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues.
    We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage
    in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable
    control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account.
    DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that
    are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of
    DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study
    of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale.
    An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.

    High-throughput sequencing assays such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq or barcode
    counting provide quantitative readouts in the form of count data. To infer
    differential signal in such data correctly and with good statistical power,
    estimation of data variability throughout the dynamic range and a suitable
    error model are required. We propose a method based on the negative binomial
    distribution, with variance and mean linked by local regression and present
    an implementation, DESeq, as an R/Bioconductor package.

    MOTIVATION:A large choice of tools exists for many standard tasks in the
    analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. However, once a project
    deviates from standard workflows, custom scripts are needed. RESULTS:We
    present HTSeq, a Python library to facilitate the rapid development of such
    scripts. HTSeq offers parsers for many common data formats in HTS projects,
    as well as classes to represent data, such as genomic coordinates,
    sequences, sequencing reads, alignments, gene model information and variant
    calls, and provides data structures that allow for querying via genomic
    coordinates. We also present htseq-count, a tool developed with HTSeq that
    preprocesses RNA-Seq data for differential expression analysis by counting
    the overlap of reads with genes. Availability and implementation: HTSeq is
    released as an open-source software under the GNU General Public Licence and
    available from http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq or from the Python Package
    Index at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/HTSeq. CONTACT:sanders@fs.tum.de.

    This protocol details the steps for data quality assessment and control that
    are typically carried out during case-control association studies. The steps
    described involve the identification and removal of DNA samples and markers
    that introduce bias. These critical steps are paramount to the success of a
    case-control study and are necessary before statistically testing for
    association. We describe how to use PLINK, a tool for handling SNP data, to
    perform assessments of failure rate per individual and per SNP and to assess
    the degree of relatedness between individuals. We also detail other
    quality-control procedures, including the use of SMARTPCA software for the
    identification of ancestral outliers. These platforms were selected because
    they are user-friendly, widely used and computationally efficient. Steps
    needed to detect and establish a disease association using case-control data
    are not discussed here. Issues concerning study design and marker selection
    in case-control studies have been discussed in our earlier protocols. This
    protocol, which is routinely used in our labs, should take approximately 8 h
    to complete.

    The avoidance response to repellent odorants in Drosophila melanogaster, a
    response essential for survival, provides an advantageous model for studies
    on the genetic architecture of behavior. Transposon tagging in a highly
    inbred strain of flies in combination with a rapid and simple statistical
    behavioral assay enables the identification of not only large phenotypic
    effects, but also small aberrations from wild-type avoidance behavior. The
    recent completion of the sequence of the Drosophila genome facilitates the
    molecular characterization of transposon-tagged genes and correlation
    between gene expression and behavior in smell-Impaired (smi) mutant lines.
    Quantitative genetic analyses of a collection of smi lines in a coisogenic
    background revealed an extensive network of epistatic interactions among
    genes that shape the olfactory avoidance response. The identification and
    functional characterization of proteins encoded by smi genes that form part
    of the olfactory subgenome and correlation of polymorphisms in these genes
    with variation in odor-guided behavior in natural populations will advance
    our understanding of the genetic architecture of chemosensory behavior.

    The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model system for
    identifying genes and determining their functions. Here we report the
    analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover
    115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric
    regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication,
    followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications,
    giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a
    cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498
    genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional
    diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans–the other sequenced
    multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but
    also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of
    common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the
    three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence
    of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of
    conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of
    plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to
    identify genes for crop improvement.

    Virtualization technologies have evolved along with the development of

    that time such as isolation, accountability, resource allocation, resource
    fair sharing and so on. Novel processor technologies bring to commodity
    computers the possibility to emulate diverse environments where a wide range
    of computational scenarios can be run. Along with processors evolution,
    system developers have created different virtualization mechanisms where
    each new development enhanced the performance of previous virtualized

    paper, the features of three container-based operating systems
    virtualization tools (LXC, Docker and Singularity) are presented. LXC,
    Docker, Singularity and bare metal are put under test through a customized
    single node HPL-Benchmark and a MPI-based application for the multi node
    testbed. Also the disk I/O performance, Memory (RAM) performance, Network
    bandwidth and GPU performance are tested for the COS technologies vs bare
    metal. Preliminary results and conclusions around them are presented and

    The HD-Zip family of transcription factors is unique to the plant kingdom.
    These proteins exhibit the singular combination of a homeodomain with a
    leucine zipper acting as a dimerization motif. They can be classified into
    four subfamilies, according to a set of distinctive features that include
    DNA-binding specificities, gene structures, additional common motifs and
    physiological functions. Some HD-Zip proteins participate in organ and
    vascular development or meristem maintenance. Others mediate the action of
    hormones or are involved in responses to environmental conditions. Here, we
    review recent data for this family of transcription factors from a wide
    variety of plant species to unravel their crucial role in plant development.

  abstract: >-
    While methods for the detection of point mutations and small insertions or
    deletions in genomic DNA are well established, the detection of larger (>
    100 6p) genomic duplications or deletions can be more difficult. Most
    mutation scanning methods use PCR as a first step, but the subsequent
    analyses are usually qualitative rather than quantitative. Gene dosage
    methods based on PCR need to be quantitative (i.e., they should report molar
    quantities of starting material) or semi-quantitative (i.e., they should
    report gene dosage relative to an internal standard). Without some sort of
    quantitation, heterozygous deletions and duplications may be overlooked and
    therefore be under-ascertained. Gene dosage methods provide the additional
    benefit of reporting allele drop-out in the PCR. This could impact on SNP
    surveys, where large-scale genotyping may miss null alleles. Here we review
    recent developments in techniques for the detection of this type of mutation
    and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses. We emphasize that
    comprehensive mutation analysis should include scanning for large insertions
    and deletions and duplications.

    BACKGROUND:MADS-box transcription factors, besides being involved in floral
    organ specification, have also been implicated in several aspects of plant
    growth and development. In recent years, there have been reports on genomic
    localization, protein motif structure, phylogenetic relationships, gene
    structure and expression of the entire MADS-box family in the model plant
    system, Arabidopsis. Though there have been some studies in rice as well, an
    analysis of the complete MADS-box family along with a comprehensive
    expression profiling was still awaited after the completion of rice genome
    sequencing. Furthermore, owing to the role of MADS-box family in flower
    development, an analysis involving structure, expression and functional
    aspects of MADS-box genes in rice and Arabidopsis was required to understand
    the role of this gene family in reproductive development. RESULTS:A
    genome-wide molecular characterization and microarray-based expression
    profiling of the genes encoding MADS-box transcription factor family in rice
    is presented. Using a thorough annotation exercise, 75 MADS-box genes have
    been identified in rice and categorized into MIKCc, MIKC*, Malpha, Mbeta and
    Mgamma groups based on phylogeny. Chromosomal localization of these genes
    reveals that 16 MADS-box genes, mostly MIKCc-type, are located within the
    duplicated segments of the rice genome, whereas most of the M-type genes, 20
    in all, seem to have resulted from tandem duplications. Nine members
    belonging to the Mbeta group, which was considered absent in monocots, have
    also been identified. The expression profiles of all the MADS-box genes have
    been analyzed under 11 temporal stages of panicle and seed development,
    three abiotic stress conditions, along with three stages of vegetative
    development. Transcripts for 31 genes accumulate preferentially in the
    reproductive phase, of which, 12 genes are specifically expressed in seeds,
    and six genes show expression specific to panicle development. Differential
    expression of seven genes under stress conditions is also evident. An
    attempt has been made to gain insight into plausible functions of rice
    MADS-box genes by collating the expression data of functionally validated
    genes in rice and Arabidopsis. CONCLUSION:Only a limited number of MADS
    genes have been functionally validated in rice. A comprehensive annotation
    and transcriptome profiling undertaken in this investigation adds to our
    understanding of the involvement of MADS-box family genes during
    reproductive development and stress in rice and also provides the basis for
    selection of candidate genes for functional validation studies.

    Knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can

    Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be
    applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in
    cells is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent

    Most agriculturally important traits are regulated by genes known as
    quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural allelic variations. We
    here show that a QTL that increases grain productivity in rice, Gn1a, is a
    gene for cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (OsCKX2), an enzyme that degrades
    the phytohormone cytokinin. Reduced expression of OsCKX2 causes cytokinin
    accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of
    reproductive organs, resulting in enhanced grain yield. QTL pyramiding to
    combine loci for grain number and plant height in the same genetic
    background generated lines exhibiting both beneficial traits. These results
    provide a strategy for tailormade crop improvement.

    Wheat gluten is an amorphous storage protein. Trypsin hydrolysis of wheat
    gluten produced glutamine-rich peptides. Some peptides were able to
    self-assemble into fibrous structures extrinsic to native wheat gluten. The
    final material was an in situ formed peptide composite of highly ordered
    nanometer-sized fibrils and micron-sized fibers embedded in an unassembled
    peptide matrix. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic and x-ray
    diffraction data suggested that the new structures resembled that of cross-
    β fibrils found in some insect silk and implicated in prion diseases. The
    largest self-assembled fibers were about 10 µm in diameter with right-handed
    helicity and appeared to be bundles of smaller nanometer-sized fibrils.
    Results demonstrated the potential for utilizing natural mechanisms of
    protein self-assembly to design advanced materials that can provide a wide
    range of structural and chemical functionality.

    DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) is a widely applied wet-lab technique to obtain
    an estimate of the overall similarity between the genomes of two organisms.
    To base the species concept for prokaryotes ultimately on DDH was chosen by
    microbiologists as a pragmatic approach for deciding about the recognition
    of novel species, but also allowed a relatively high degree of
    standardization compared to other areas of taxonomy. However, DDH is tedious
    and error-prone and first and foremost cannot be used to incrementally
    establish a comparative database. Recent studies have shown that in-silico
    methods for the comparison of genome sequences can be used to replace DDH.
    Considering the ongoing rapid technological progress of sequencing methods,
    genome-based prokaryote taxonomy is coming into reach. However, calculating
    distances between genomes is dependent on multiple choices for software and
    program settings. We here provide an overview over the modifications that
    can be applied to distance methods based in high-scoring segment pairs
    (HSPs) or maximally unique matches (MUMs) and that need to be documented.
    General recommendations on determining HSPs using BLAST or other algorithms
    are also provided. As a reference implementation, we introduce the GGDC web
    server ( http://ggdc.gbdp.org ).

    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are similar to21-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that have been
    identified in both animals and plants. Although in animals there is direct
    evidence implicating particular miRNAs in the control of developmental
    timing, to date it is not known whether plant miRNAs also play a role in
    regulating temporal transitions. Through an activation-tagging approach, we
    demonstrate that miRNA 172 (miR172) causes early flowering and disrupts the
    specification of floral organ identity when overexpressed in Arabidopsis.
    miR172 normally is expressed in a temporal manner, consistent with its
    proposed role in flowering time control. The regulatory target of miR172 is
    a subfamily of APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor genes. We present
    evidence that miR172 downregulates these target genes by a translational
    mechanism rather than by RNA cleavage. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function
    analyses indicate that two of the AP2-like target genes normally act as
    floral repressors, supporting the notion that miR172 regulates flowering
    time by downregulating AP2-like target genes.

    Understanding how genotypes map unto phenotypes implies an integrative
    understanding of the processes regulating cell differentiation and
    morphogenesis, which comprise development. Such a task requires the use of
    theoretical and computational approaches to integrate and follow the
    concerted action of multiple genetic and nongenetic components that hold
    highly nonlinear interactions. Gene regulatory network (GRN) models have
    been proposed to approach such task. GRN models have become very useful to
    understand how such types of interactions restrict the multi-gene expression
    patterns that characterize different cell-fates. More recently, such
    temporal single-cell models have been extended to recover the temporal and
    spatial components of morphogenesis. Since the complete genomic GRN is still
    unknown and intractable for any organism, and some clear developmental
    modules have been identified, we focus here on the analysis of well-curated
    and experimentally grounded small GRN modules. One of the first
    experimentally grounded GRN that was proposed and validated corresponds to
    the regulatory module involved in floral organ determination. In this
    chapter we use this GRN as an example of the methodologies involved in: (1)
    formalizing and integrating molecular genetic data into the logical
    functions (Boolean functions) that rule gene interactions and dynamics in a
    Boolean GRN; (2) the algorithms and computational approaches used to recover
    the steady-states that correspond to each cell type, as well as the set of
    initial GRN configurations that lead to each one of such states (i.e.,
    basins of attraction); (3) the approaches used to validate a GRN model using
    wild type and mutant or overexpression data, or to test the robustness of
    the GRN being proposed; (4) some of the methods that have been used to
    incorporate random fluctuations in the GRN Boolean functions and enable
    stochastic GRN models to address the temporal sequence with which gene
    configurations and cell fates are attained; (5) the methodologies used to
    approximate discrete Boolean GRN to continuous systems and their use in
    further dynamic analyses. The methodologies explained for the GRN of floral
    organ determination developed here in detail can be applied to any other
    functional developmental module.

    RNA-Sequencing analysis methods are rapidly evolving, and the tool choice
    for each step of one common workflow, differential expression analysis,
    which includes read alignment, expression modeling, and differentially
    expressed gene identification, has a dramatic impact on performance
    characteristics. Although a number of workflows are emerging as high
    performers that are robust to diverse input types, the relative performance
    characteristics of these workflows when either read depth or sample number
    is limited–a common occurrence in real-world practice–remain unexplored.

  abstract: >-
    Synergism with piperonyl butoxide indicated that enhanced P450 activity is
    likely associated with pyrethroid resistance in an isogenic
    cypermethrin-resistant (CR) strain of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella
    xylostella (L). Eleven P450 genes, including 8 novel ones, were cloned from
    DBM, and their basal and cypermethrin-induced transcription levels were
    compared between insecticide-susceptible (Sus) and CR strains. One P450 gene
    was determined to be constitutively overtranscribed in CR strain. To
    determine the conditions resulting in maximum levels of P450 gene induction
    by cypermethrin, several factors, including routes of insecticide
    administration (topical vs. leaf dip), exposure amounts and durations of
    exposure, were examined. In general, the leaf dip method resulted in greater
    levels of induction in a wider array of P450 genes. The conditions of 'low
    sub-lethal amounts and short exposures' to cypermethrin were more efficient
    in P450 induction than those of 'high amounts (e.g., LD50 or LC50) and long
    exposures'. Cross-strain comparisons revealed that 8 of 11 P450 genes were
    induced (1.5- to 2.2-fold) in CR larvae whereas only a single P450 gene was
    induced in Sus larvae under optimal induction conditions. This finding
    demonstrates that selective P450 gene induction by cypermethrin in addition
    to constitutive overexpression can confer metabolic resistance in the CR
    strain. Current study also provides a framework for future induction
    experiments for the transcriptional profiling of insect detoxification genes
    in response to insecticide exposure. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

    Vitamin A (retinol), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and vitamin E (a-tocopherol)
    are each thought to play an important role in the aging process. Here, we
    investigated the effects of these vitamins on Drosophila melanogaster life
    span under different oxidative stress conditions. Among the vitamins tested,
    a-tocopherol exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity, extending average
    and maximum life span for wild-type flies under hyperoxia and for Cu/Zn
    superoxide dismutase-deficient (SOD1-deficient) flies under normoxia.
    Retinol supplementation extended life span of SOD1-deficient flies under
    normoxia, and ascorbic acid supplementation extended life span of wild-type
    flies under normoxia. However, both retinol and ascorbic acid exhibited a
    strong prooxidant activity under hyperoxia and shortened life span.
    Furthermore, ascorbic acid supplementation enhanced the toxic effects of
    iron, with the iron pool significantly increased in adult whole-body
    extracts. Taken together, our results document antioxidant and prooxidant
    contributions of vitamins to D. melanogaster life-span determination under
    normoxia and under oxidative stress.

    Selaginella (spikemoss) is an enigma in the plant kingdom. Although a
    fascination to botanists at the turn of the twentieth century, members of
    this genus are unremarkable in appearance, never flower, and are of no
    agronomic value. However, members of this genus are relicts from ancient
    times, and one has to marvel at how this genus has survived virtually
    unchanged in appearance for hundreds of millions of years. In light of the
    recent completion of the Selaginella moellendorffii genome sequence, this
    review is intended to survey what is known about Selaginella, with a special
    emphasis on recent inquiries into its unique biology and importance in
    understanding the early evolution of vascular plants.

  abstract: >-
    Vascular plants appeared \textasciitilde410 million years ago, then diverged
    into several lineages of which only two survive: the euphyllophytes (ferns
    and seed plants) and the lycophytes. We report here the genome sequence of
    the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii (Selaginella), the first nonseed
    vascular plant genome reported. By comparing gene content in evolutionarily
    diverse taxa, we found that the transition from a gametophyte- to a
    sporophyte-dominated life cycle required far fewer new genes than the
    transition from a nonseed vascular to a flowering plant, whereas secondary
    metabolic genes expanded extensively and in parallel in the lycophyte and
    angiosperm lineages. Selaginella differs in posttranscriptional gene
    regulation, including small RNA regulation of repetitive elements, an
    absence of the trans-acting small interfering RNA pathway, and extensive RNA
    editing of organellar genes.

    A laboratory study investigated development of teratocytes derived from the
    parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides Loan in the natural host, Sitona
    discoideus Gyllenhal, and in three novel hosts, the introduced weed
    biological control agent Rhinocyllus conicus (Froehlich), and two New
    Zealand native species Nicaeana cervina Broun and Irenimus stolidus Broun.
    Weevils were exposed to parasitoids and then examined 6, 10 and 15 days
    post-parasitism for parasitoid stage and size, and teratocyte number and
    size. In all hosts, teratocyte numbers decreased and size increased as
    parasitoid development progressed, although 6 days after parasitism, fewer,
    larger teratocytes were found in I. stolidus than S. discoideus or N.
    cervina. In weevils containing second-third instar parasitoid larvae, the
    most permissive hosts, S. discoideus and N. cervina contained more
    teratocytes than the least permissive hosts I. stolidus and R. conicus. Host
    gender influenced some aspects of parasitoid and teratocyte development.
    Total teratocyte volume was greater in female than male S. discoideus at all
    sampling times, and at 10 days post-parasitism in N. cervina. A possible
    relationship between host suitability and teratocyte development is
    discussed.

    AbstractA laboratory study of aspects of parasitoid host acceptance,
    suitability and physiological regulation in natural and novel host species
    was carried out to investigate the degree of variability encountered with
    different hosts and to determine the value of such observations in host
    range determination. The parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides Loan was
    exposed to a natural host, Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera:
    Curculionidae) and three novel hosts, the New Zealand native Nicaeana
    cervinaBroun, the introduced weed biological control agent Rhinocyllus
    conicus (Froehlich), and a congeneric pest species, Sitona lepidus Gyllenhal
    (all Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Per cent parasitism of these species was
    54%, 43%, 39% and 0%, respectively. The results indicated that for both S.
    discoideus and R. conicus more males than females were parasitized (69% cf.
    45%, and 49% cf. 32% respectively) but host size was not a significant
    factor. Overall, superparasitism was recorded in about 29% of parasitized
    weevils and there was evidence that host discrimination to avoid
    superparasitism occurred in the natural host. Conversely, superparasitism
    occurred more frequently than would be expected in N. cervina (42%) coupled
    with higher survival of larvae in superparasitized hosts in this species.
    The frequency distribution of attack of R. conicus by M. aethiopoides was
    not different from random. Parasitoid development was more rapid in the
    natural host, S. discoideus, and parasitoid size was positively correlated
    with host size. There was a strong positive relationship between parasitoid
    larval survival and the presence of teratocytes in all hosts. Host fecundity
    and fertility were reduced by parasitism for most species, and in some
    cases, by exposure to parasitoids in the absence of detectable parasitism.
    It was concluded that laboratory observations can provide useful information
    on the compatibility between host and parasitoid which can complement
    traditional host range tests to predict field host range.

    The morphology of the female reproductive system ofMicroctonus
    aethiopoidesis described and illustrated, and an ultrastructural examination
    of the ovaries was carried out. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were initially
    found in the ovarial epithelial cells of females from pre-adult emergence
    from the pupal cocoon until at least 5 days after emergence. The particles
    assembled in the nucleus of the epithelial cells, apparently being
    synthesizedde novoin association with a putative virogenic stroma, and they
    moved into the lumen of the ovarioles surrounding the developing eggs. VLPs
    were also found in some other cells in both male and femaleM. aethiopoides.
    VLPs have not been found inM. hyperodaeor the New Zealand native speciesM.
    zealandicus. The function of the VLP and its possible role in potential
    parasitoid host range determination are discussed.

    Virus-like particles (MaVLP) have been discovered in the ovarial epithelial
    cells of the solitary, koinobiont, endoparasitoid, Microctonus aethiopoides
    Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) introduced to New Zealand originally from
    Morocco to control the lucerne pest Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera:
    Curculionidae). MaVLP have been found in all females examined. It has been
    suggested, although not demonstrated, that like many other such VLP found in
    parasitoids, MaVLP might play a role in host immunosuppression. Since
    another biotype of M. aethiopoides from Ireland has been proposed for
    introduction to control the white clover pest, Sitona lepidus Gyllenhal, in
    New Zealand, it was considered that females from this biotype warranted
    transmission electron microscope examination for VLP. No VLP were observed
    in ovarian tissues of specimens collected from three different locations in
    Ireland. Similarly, none were found in M. aethiopoides sourced from France,
    Wales, and Norway. These observations are discussed in relation to
    quarantine host specificity tests with the Irish biotype, which found that
    the host range of the Irish biotype is likely to be less extensive than that
    of the Moroccan biotype already in New Zealand.

    Morphogens can control organ development by regulating patterning as well as
    growth. Here we use the model system of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc to
    address how the patterning signal Decapentaplegic (Dpp) regulates cell
    proliferation. Contrary to previous models, which implicated the slope of
    the Dpp gradient as an essential driver of cell proliferation, we find that
    the juxtaposition of cells with differential pathway activity is not
    required for proliferation. Additionally, our results demonstrate that, as
    is the case for patterning, Dpp controls wing growth entirely via repression
    of the target gene brinker (brk). The Dpp-Brk system converts an inherently
    uneven growth program, with excessive cell proliferation in lateral regions
    and low proliferation in medial regions, into a spatially homogeneous
    profile of cell divisions throughout the disc.

    The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L. (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) has resurged
    as one of the most troublesome household pests affecting people across the
    globe. Bed bug infestations have increased in recent years primarily due to
    the evolution of insecticide resistance and the insect’s ability to
    hitchhike with travelers. vATPases are one of the most evolutionarily
    conserved holoenzymes in eukaryotes, which are mainly involved in proton
    transport across the plasma membranes and intracellular organelles. RNA
    interference (RNAi) has been developed as a promising tool for insect
    control. In this study, we used RNAi as an approach to knock down subunits A
    and E of the vATPase gene of bed bugs. Delivery of 0.2 µg/insect of dsRNA
    specific to vATPase-A and vATPase-E into female bed bugs dramatically
    impaired the laying and viability of eggs over time. Injection of the
    vATPase-E dsRNA decreased survival of the bed bugs over 30 d. Our results
    also showed that the knockdown of mRNA is highly effective and persistent up
    to 30 d post injection. This research demonstrated that silencing of the two
    vATPase subunits A and E offers a potential strategy to suppress bed bug
    populations.

    Host plant shifts of herbivorous insects may be a first step toward
    sympatric speciation and can create new pests of agriculturally important
    crops; however, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process are
    poorly understood. Certain races of the polyphagous aphid Myzus persicae
    have recently adapted to feed on tobacco (Myzus persicae nicotianae) and
    show a reduced sensitivity to the plant alkaloid nicotine and
    cross-resistance to neonicotinoids a class of synthetic insecticides widely
    used for control. Here we show constitutive overexpression of a cytochrome
    P450 (CYP6CY3) allows tobacco-adapted races of M. persicae to efficiently
    detoxify nicotine and has preadapted them to resist neonicotinoid
    insecticides. CYP6CY3, is highly overexpressed in M. persicae nicotianae
    clones from three continents compared with M. persicae s.s. and expression
    level is significantly correlated with tolerance to nicotine. CYP6CY3 is
    highly efficient (compared with the primary human nicotine-metabolizing
    P450) at metabolizing nicotine and neonicotinoids to less toxic metabolites
    in vitro and generation of transgenic Drosophila expressing CYP6CY3
    demonstrate that it confers resistance to both compounds in vivo.
    Overexpression of CYP6CY3 results from the expansion of a dinucleotide
    microsatellite in the promoter region and a recent gene amplification, with
    some aphid clones carrying up to 100 copies. We conclude that the mutations
    leading to overexpression of CYP6CY3 were a prerequisite for the host shift
    of M. persicae to tobacco and that gene amplification and microsatellite
    polymorphism are evolutionary drivers in insect host adaptation.

    The first neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, was launched in 1991.
    Today this class of insecticides comprises at least seven major compounds
    with a market share of more than 25% of total global insecticide sales.
    Neonicotinoid insecticides are highly selective agonists of insect nicotinic
    acetylcholine receptors and provide farmers with invaluable, highly
    effective tools against some of the world's most destructive crop pests.
    These include sucking pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and planthoppers,
    and also some coleopteran, dipteran and lepidopteran species. Although many
    insect species are still successfully controlled by neonicotinoids, their
    popularity has imposed a mounting selection pressure for resistance, and in
    several species resistance has now reached levels that compromise the
    efficacy of these insecticides. Research to understand the molecular basis
    of neonicotinoid resistance has revealed both target-site and metabolic
    mechanisms conferring resistance. For target-site resistance, field-evolved
    mutations have only been characterized in two aphid species. Metabolic
    resistance appears much more common, with the enhanced expression of one or
    more cytochrome P450s frequently reported in resistant strains. Despite the
    current scale of resistance, neonicotinoids remain a major component of many
    pest control programmes, and resistance management strategies, based on mode
    of action rotation, are of crucial importance in preventing resistance
    becoming more widespread. In this review we summarize the current status of
    neonicotinoid resistance, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved,
    and the implications for resistance management.

  abstract: "The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is an economically significant pest of rice throughout Asia and has evolved resistance to many insecticides including the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. The resistance of field populations of N.\_lugens to imidacloprid has been attributed to enhanced detoxification by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), although, to date, the causative P450(s) has (have) not been identified. In the present study, biochemical assays using the model substrate 7-ethoxycoumarin showed enhanced P450 activity in several resistant N.\_lugens field strains when compared with a susceptible reference strain. Thirty three cDNA sequences encoding tentative unique P450s were identified from two recent sequencing projects and by degenerate PCR. The mRNA expression level of 32 of these was examined in susceptible, moderately resistant and highly resistant N.\_lugens strains using quantitative real-time PCR. A single P450 gene (CYP6ER1) was highly overexpressed in all resistant strains (up to 40-fold) and the level of expression observed in the different N.\_lugens strains was significantly correlated with the resistance phenotype. These results provide strong evidence for a role of CYP6ER1 in the resistance of N.\_lugens to imidacloprid."

    Efficient construction of BAC-based human artificial chromosomes (HACs)
    requires optimization of each key functional unit as well as development of
    techniques for the rapid and reliable manipulation of high-molecular weight
    BAC vectors. Here, we have created synthetic chromosome 17-derived
    alpha-satellite arrays, based on the 16-monomer repeat length typical of
    natural D17Z1 arrays, in which the consensus CENP-B box elements are either
    completely absent (0/16 monomers) or increased in density (16/16 monomers)
    compared to D17Z1 alpha-satellite (5/16 monomers). Using these vectors, we
    show that the presence of CENP-B box elements is a requirement for efficient
    de novo centromere formation and that increasing the density of CENP-B box
    elements may enhance the efficiency of de novo centromere formation.
    Furthermore, we have developed a novel, high-throughput methodology that
    permits the rapid conversion of any genomic BAC target into a HAC vector by
    transposon-mediated modification with synthetic alpha-satellite arrays and
    other key functional units. Taken together, these approaches offer the
    potential to significantly advance the utility of BAC-based HACs for
    functional annotation of the genome and for applications in gene transfer.

    Many plants and animals are capable of developing in a variety of ways,
    forming characteristics that are well adapted to the environments in which
    they are likely to live. In adverse circumstances, for example, small size
    and slow metabolism can facilitate survival, whereas larger size and more
    rapid metabolism have advantages for reproductive success when resources are
    more abundant. Often these characteristics are induced in early life or are
    even set by cues to which their parents or grandparents were exposed.
    Individuals developmentally adapted to one environment may, however, be at
    risk when exposed to another when they are older. The biological evidence
    may be relevant to the understanding of human development and susceptibility
    to disease. As the nutritional state of many human mothers has improved
    around the world, the characteristics of their offspring—such as body size
    and metabolism—have also changed. Responsiveness to their mothers' condition
    before birth may generally prepare individuals so that they are best suited
    to the environment forecast by cues available in early life. Paradoxically,
    however, rapid improvements in nutrition and other environmental conditions
    may have damaging effects on the health of those people whose parents and
    grandparents lived in impoverished conditions. A fuller understanding of
    patterns of human plasticity in response to early nutrition and other
    environmental factors will have implications for the administration of
    public health.

  abstract: >-
    The electrophoretic pattern of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) of Drosophila
    mojavensis is composed of multiple bands. In previous studies from this
    laboratory we suggested on the basis of genetic evidence that multiple ADH
    bands were due to the presence of a gene duplication. In the studies
    presented here, this hypothesis is supported by data derived from comparing
    the protein biochemistry of each ADH. Three forms of D. mojavensis ADH have
    been isolated. These are the ADH-1 homodimer, the ADH-2 homodimer, and the
    ADH-1 ADH-2 interlocus heterodimer. Each of these isozymes has a native
    molecular weight of approximately 50,000. Each native molecule is composed
    of two subunits of identical size, 24,000 daltons. The native molecules
    differ slightly in their isoelectric points. Thermal denaturation also
    reveals that ADH-1 and ADH-2 are slightly different, ADH-1 being somewhat
    more thermostable. The interlocus heterodimer has properties intermediate
    between those of ADH-1 and those of ADH-2. Kinetic comparison also indicates
    a similarity among the three isozymes. ADH-2 is somewhat better at oxidizing
    ethanol relative to 2-propanol as compared to ADH-1. All of our studies
    support the general conclusion that the isozymes of ADH found in D.
    mojavensis are similar to one another and to other ADH from other species of
    Drosophila. This supports our hypothesis that multiple bands of ADH in D.
    mojavensis reflect the presence of a duplication of the Adh locus in that
    species.

  abstract: >-
    These studies report the existence of multiple forms of alcohol
    dehydrogenase in extracts of Drosophila mojavensis. The existence of these
    forms can be best explained by the hypothesis of a duplication for the Adh
    locus in D. mojavensis. Electrophoretic variants at each locus have been
    identified and crosses between individuals carrying alternative alleles at
    each locus result in F1 progeny with six bands of ADH. This pattern is
    consistent with these individuals being heterozygous at two loci. The loci
    have been named Adh-1 and Adh-2. Examination of the isozyme content during
    development shows that the two Adh genes are not coordinately controlled but
    have separate developmental programs. In embryos and first and second instar
    larvae only Adh-1 is expressed. At about the time of the second molt Adh-2
    expression commences in some of the same cells that previously expressed and
    continue to express Adh-1. This is evidenced by the existence of an
    interlocus heterodimer in third instar larvae. Both genes are expressed
    throughout pupation. Shortly after emergence Adh-1 expression declines. In
    mature males only ADH-2 is present. In mature females both Adh-1 and Adh-2
    are expressed but not in the same cells since the interlocus heterodimer is
    absent. Examination of specific tissues reveals that most of the larval ADH
    is found in fat body cells and as in most tissues of third instar larvae
    both Adh-1 and Adh-2 are expressed. The single exception appears to be
    larval gut which contains ADH-1 but little if any ADH-2. In mature males and
    female flies all ADH containing tissues have only ADH-2. However, mature
    ovaries contain substantial quantities of ADH-1 which is apparently
    deposited into eggs. Given the extensive amount of available information on
    the Adh gene-enzyme system of D. melanogaster and the tools that can be
    applied to the analysis of homologous systems, the ADH duplication of D.
    mojavensis, and its regulation may be a useful one for studying differential
    gene regulation in specific cell types.

  abstract: >-
    Patterns of nucleotide polymorphism within populations of Drosophila
    melanogaster suggest that insecticides have been the selective agents
    driving the strongest recent bouts of positive selection. However, there is
    a need to explicitly link selective sweeps to the particular insecticide
    phenotypes that could plausibly account for the drastic selective responses
    that are observed in these non-target insects. Here, we screen the
    Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel with two common insecticides; malathion
    (an organophosphate) and permethrin (a pyrethroid). Genome-wide association
    studies map survival on malathion to two of the largest sweeps in the D.
    melanogaster genome; Ace and Cyp6g1. Malathion survivorship also correlates
    with lines which have high levels of Cyp12d1, Jheh1 and Jheh2 transcript
    abundance. Permethrin phenotypes map to the largest cluster of P450 genes in
    the Drosophila genome, however in contrast to a selective sweep driven by
    insecticide use, the derived allele seems to be associated with
    susceptibility. These results underscore previous findings that highlight
    the importance of structural variation to insecticide phenotypes: Cyp6g1
    exhibits copy number variation and transposable element insertions, Cyp12d1
    is tandemly duplicated, the Jheh loci are associated with a Bari1
    transposable element insertion, and a Cyp6a17 deletion is associated with
    susceptibility.

    Different procedures for obtaining homology models for P450s are
    investigated using various sequence alignments sharing various levels of
    sequence identity with available P450 crystal structures. In this analysis,
    we have investigated how well homology modeling can reproduce known crystal
    structures as well as how effectively these homology models can be used to
    reproduce known ligand-binding modes. Homology models obtained from sequence
    alignments that discriminate between Class I and Class II P450s are
    significantly closer to the experimental crystal structures and more closely
    reproduce known ligand's binding modes, than those obtained using sequence
    alignments that combine Class I and Class II P450s. The quality of the
    models is slightly improved by constructing hybrid-structure models that
    model three of the most variable regions of P450s independently from the
    rest of the protein: the B region that includes SRS1, the FG region that
    includes SRS2 and SRS3 and the beta 4 region that includes SRS6.

  abstract: >-
    We have previously reported that a cytochrome P450, CYP6BG1, from Plutella
    xylostella was found to be overexpressed in 4th instars of a permethrin
    resistant strain and inducible in the susceptible counterpart. The findings
    suggested potential involvement of CYP6BG1 in permethrin resistance, hence
    warranted a functional analysis. To assess the functional link of the gene
    to permethrin resistance, we adopted RNA interference-mediated gene
    silencing (RNAi) by dsRNA droplet feeding. Here, real time PCR analyses show
    that oral delivery of dsRNA can efficiently reduce the expression of
    CYP6BG1. Knockdown of CYP6BG1 transcript was evident in midgut and larval
    tissues enclosed in carcass. As a consequence of knockdown, a significant
    reduction in resistance of larvae fed CYP6BG1 dsRNA was observed after 24
    and 48h of exposure to permethrin. In addition, CYP6BG1 dsRNA feeding to
    larvae led to reduced total P450 activities of microsomal preparations
    toward model substrates p-nitroanisole and benzyloxyresorufin. These results
    indicate that the overexpressed CYP6BG1 participate in enhanced metabolism
    of permethrin, thereby, resistance. The knockdown of a non-overexpressed
    P450, CYP6BF1v4, from the same resistant P. xylostella strain did not lead
    to changes in the level of resistance to permethrin, supporting further the
    specific involvement of CYP6BG1 in the resistance.

    RNA sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS, RNA-Seq) technologies
    is currently the standard approach for gene expression profiling,
    particularly for large-scale high-throughput studies. NGS technologies
    comprise short-read RNA-Seq (dominated by Illumina) and long-read RNA-Seq
    technologies provided by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore
    Technologies (ONT). Although short-read sequencing technologies are the most
    widely used, long-read technologies are increasingly becoming the standard
    approach for de novo transcriptome assembly and isoform expression
    quantification due to the complex nature of the transcriptome which consists
    of variable lengths of transcripts and multiple alternatively spliced
    isoforms for most genes. In this chapter, we describe experimental
    procedures for library preparation, sequencing, and associated data analysis
    approaches for PacBio and ONT with a major focus on full length cDNA
    synthesis, de novo transcriptome assembly, and isoform quantification.

  abstract: >-
    The host regulation process has been widely investigated in endophagous
    parasitoid wasps, which in most cases finely interact with living hosts
    (i.e. koinobiont parasitoids). In contrast, only very limited information is
    available for ectophagous parasitoids that permanently paralyze and rapidly
    suppress their victims (i.e. idiobiont parasitoids). Here we try to fill
    this research gap by investigating the host regulation by Bracon nigricans,
    an ectophagous idiobiont wasp species. Parasitism, mainly by venom action,
    is able to redirect host metabolism in order to enhance its nutritional
    suitability for the developing parasitoid larvae and to provide the required
    metabolic support to host tissues. The observed alterations of the host
    titers of haemolymph proteins, carbohydrates and acylglycerols are
    associated with a parasitoid-induced mobilization of nutrients stored in the
    fat body. This tissue undergoes a controlled degradation mediated by a close
    surface interaction with haemocytes, where a cathepsin L activity is
    localized, as demonstrated by immunolocalization, biochemical and
    transcriptional data. B. nigricans parasitism does not markedly influence
    the survival of haemocytes, even though a persistent suppression of the
    immune competence is observed in parasitized hosts, which show a reduced
    capacity to encapsulate and melanize non-self objects. These immune
    alterations likely allow a more efficient food uptake and use by the
    ectophagous larvae. The obtained results indicate that the host regulation
    process in basal lineages of parasitic Hymenoptera is more complex than
    expected and shares functional similarities with adaptive strategies
    occurring in derived koinobiont species.

    The interrelationship of morphogenesis and metabolism is a poorly studied
    phenomenon. The main paradigm is that development is controlled by gene
    expression. The aim of the present study was to correlate metabolism to
    early and late stages of flower and fruit development in order to provide
    the basis for the identification of metabolic adjustment and limitations. A
    highly detailed picture of morphogenesis is achieved using nondestructive
    micro computed tomography. This technique was used to quantify morphometric
    parameters of early and late flower development in an Arabidopsis thaliana
    mutant with synchronized flower initiation. The synchronized flower
    phenotype made it possible to sample enough early floral tissue otherwise
    not accessible for metabolomic analysis. The integration of metabolomic and
    morphometric data enabled the correlation of metabolic signatures with the
    process of flower morphogenesis. These signatures changed significantly
    during development, indicating a pronounced metabolic reprogramming in the
    tissue. Distinct sets of metabolites involved in these processes were
    identified and were linked to the findings of previous gene expression
    studies of flower development. High correlations with basic leucine zipper
    (bZIP) transcription factors and nitrogen metabolism genes involved in the
    control of metabolic carbon : nitrogen partitioning were revealed. Based on
    these observations a model for metabolic adjustment during flower
    development is proposed.

    The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) strives to disrupt each
    Drosophila gene by the insertion of a single transposable element. As part
    of this effort, transposons in >30,000 fly strains were localized and
    analyzed relative to predicted Drosophila gene Structures. Approximately
    6300 lines that maximize genomic coverage were selected to be sent to the
    Bloomington Stock Center for public distribution, bringing the size of the
    BDGP gene disruption collection to 7140 lines. It now includes individual
    lines predicted to disrupt 5362 of the 13,666 currently annotated Drosophila
    genes (39%). Other lines contain an insertion at least 2 kb from others in
    the collection and likely mutate additional incompletely annotated or
    uncharacterized genes and chromosomal regulatory elements. The remaining
    strains contain insertions likely to disrupt alternative gene promoters or
    to allow gene misexpression. The expanded BDGP gene disruption collection
    provides a public resource that will facilitate the application of
    Drosophila,genetics to diverse biological problems. Finally, the project
    reveals new insight into how transposons interact with a eukaryotic genome
    and helps define optimal strategies for using insertional mutagenesis as a
    genomic tool.

    Olfactory stimulation induces an odor-guided crawling behavior of Drosophila
    melanogaster larvae characterized by either an attractive or a repellent
    reaction. In order to understand the underlying processes leading to these
    orientations we stimulated single olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through
    photo-activation within an intact neuronal network. Using the Gal4-UAS
    system two light inducible proteins, the light-sensitive cation channel
    channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR-2) or the light-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (Pac α)
    were expressed in all or in individual ORNs of the larval olfactory system.
    Blue light stimulation caused an activation of these neurons, ultimately
    producing the illusion of an odor stimulus. Larvae were tested in a
    phototaxis assay for their orientation towards or away from the light
    source. Here we show that activation of Pacα expressing ORNs bearing the
    receptors Or33b or Or45a in blind norpA mutant larvae induces a repellent
    behavior away from the light. Conversely, photo-activation of the majority
    of ORNs induces attraction towards the light. Interestingly, in wild type
    larvae two ligands of Or33b and Or45a, octyl acetate and propionic
    ethylester, respectively, have been found to cause an escape reaction.
    Therefore, we combined light and odor stimulation to analyze the function of
    Or33b and Or45a expressing ORNs. We show that the larval olfactory system
    contains a designated neuronal pathway for repellent odorants and that
    activation of a specific class of ORNs already determines olfactory
    avoidance behavior.

    Premise of the study: DNA metabarcoding has broad-ranging applications in
    ecology, aerobiology, biosecurity, and forensics. A bioinformatics pipeline
    has recently been published for identification using a comprehensive
    database of ITS2, one of the common plant DNA barcoding markers. There is,
    however, no corresponding database for rbcL, the other primary marker used
    in plants.  Methods: Using publicly available data, we compiled a reference
    library of rbcL sequences and trained databases for use with UTAX and RDP
    classifier algorithms. We used this reference library, along with the
    existing bioinformatics pipeline and ITS2 reference library, to identify
    species in an artificial mixture of nine species of pollen. We have made
    this database publicly available in multiple formats, to allow use with
    multiple bioinformatics pipelines, now and in the future.  Results: Using
    the rbcL database, in addition to the ITS2 database, we succeeded in making
    species-level identifications for eight species and a family-level
    identification of the ninth species. This is an improvement on ITS2 sequence
    alone.  Discussion: The reference library described here will assist with
    identification of plant species using rbcL. By making another gene region
    available for standard barcoding, this will increase the resolution and
    accuracy of identifications.

    We describe a method, Hi–C, to comprehensively detect chromatin interactions
    in the mammalian nucleus. This method is based on Chromosome Conformation
    Capture, in which chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, then digested,
    and re-ligated in such a way that only DNA fragments that are covalently
    linked together form ligation products. The ligation products contain the
    information of not only where they originated from in the genomic sequence
    but also where they reside, physically, in the 3D organization of the
    genome. In Hi–C, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation
    junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions
    followed by deep sequencing. The compatibility of Hi–C with next generation
    sequencing platforms makes it possible to detect chromatin interactions on
    an unprecedented scale. This advance gives Hi–C the power to both explore
    the biophysical properties of chromatin as well as the implications of
    chromatin structure for the biological functions of the nucleus. A massively
    parallel survey of chromatin interaction provides the previously missing
    dimension of spatial context to other genomic studies. This spatial context
    will provide a new perspective to studies of chromatin and its role in
    genome regulation in normal conditions and in disease.

    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are involved in metabolism of hostplant
    allelochemicals by larval Lepidoptera. Biochemical purification of the P450
    polypeptide induced in Papilio polyxenes (black swallowtail) larvae in
    response to xanthotoxin, a linear furanocoumarin, has allowed us to clone
    cDNAs encoding two allelic variants of the CYP6B1 locus. Expression of these
    alleles in lepidopteran cell lines using baculovirus expression vectors has
    demonstrated that both P450 isoforms metabolize substantial amounts of
    linear furanocoumarins, such as xanthotoxin and bergapten, but not angular
    furanocoumarins, such as angelicin and sphondin. These linear
    furanocoumarins are ubiquitous constituents of the hostplants of P.
    polyxenes. The efficiency of linear furanocoumarin metabolism is strongly
    affected by the nature of the substituents on the benzene ring;
    methoxy-derivatives are metabolized more efficiently than are derivatives
    with smaller (hydroxy-) or larger (8-O isopentenyl) groups. Metabolism of
    either bergapten or xanthotoxin is inhibited in the presence of the other.
    In addition, metabolism of linear furanocoumarins is inhibited by the
    presence of nonmetabolizable angular furanocoumarins, indicating that the
    active site of CYP6B1 binds angular furanocoumarins. The reactivities
    described here indicate that P. polyxenes larvae express at least two
    selective furanocoumarin-metabolic P450s: CYP6B1, which metabolizes a
    discrete set of linear furanocoumarins, and another P450, as yet
    unidentified, which metabolizes angular furanocoumarins more efficiently
    than does CYP6B1. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

  abstract: >-
    Two potential outcomes of a coevolutionary interaction are an escalating
    arms race and stable cycling. The general expectation has been that arms
    races predominate in cases of polygenic inheritance of resistance traits and
    permanent cycling predominates in cases in which resistance is controlled by
    major genes. In the interaction between Depressaria pastinacella, the
    parsnip webworm, and Pastinaca sativa, the wild parsnip, traits for plant
    resistance to insect herbivory (production of defensive furanocoumarins) as
    well as traits for herbivore "virulence" (ability to metabolize
    furanocoumarins) are characterized by continuous heritable variation.
    Furanocoumarin production in plants and rates of metabolism in insects were
    compared among four midwestern populations; these traits then were
    classified into four clusters describing multitrait phenotypes occurring in
    all or most of the populations. When the frequency of plant phenotypes
    belonging to each of the clusters is compared with the frequency of the
    insect phenotypes in each of the clusters across populations, a remarkable
    degree of frequency matching is revealed in three of the populations. That
    frequencies of phenotypes vary among populations is consistent with the fact
    that spatial variation occurs in the temporal cycling of phenotypes; such
    processes contribute in generating a geographic mosaic in this
    coevolutionary interaction on the landscape scale. Comparisons of
    contemporary plant phenotype distributions with phenotypes of herbarium
    specimens collected 9-125 years ago from across a similar latitudinal
    gradient, however, suggest that for at least one resistance trait-sphondin
    concentration-interactions with webworms have led to escalatory change.

  abstract: >-
    Defensive chemicals used by organisms for protection against potential
    consumers are generally products of secondary metabolism. Such chemicals are
    characteristic of free-living organisms with a limited range of movement or
    limited control over their movements. Despite the fact that chemical defense
    is widespread among animals as well as plants, the vast majority of theories
    advanced to account for patterns of allocation of energy and materials to
    defensive chemistry derive exclusively from studies of plant-herbivore
    interactions. Many such theories place an undue emphasis on primary
    physiological processes that are unique to plants (e.g., photosynthesis),
    rendering such theories limited in their utility or predictive power. The
    general failure of any single all-encompassing theory to gain acceptance to
    date may indicate that such a theory might not be a biologically realistic
    expectation. In lieu of refining theory, focusing attention on the genetic
    and biochemical mechanisms that underlie chemical defense allocation is
    likely to provide greater insights into understanding patterns across taxa.
    In particular, generalizations derived from understanding such mechanisms in
    natural systems have immediate applications in altering patterns of human
    use of natural and synthetic chemicals for pest control.

    Despite the fact that Papilio glaucus and Papilio polyxenes share no single
    hostplant species, both species feed to varying extents on hostplants that
    contain furanocoumarins. P. glaucus contains two nearly identical genes,
    CYP6B4v2 and CYP6B5v1, and P. polyxenes contains two related genes, CYP6B1v3
    and CYP6B3v2. Except for CYP6B3v2, the substrate specificity of which has
    not yet been defined, each of the encoded cytochrome P450 monooxygenases
    (P450s) metabolizes an array of linear furanocoumarins. All four genes are
    transcriptionally induced in larvae by exposure to the furanocoumarin
    xanthotoxin; several are also induced by other furanocoumarins. Comparisons
    of the organizational structures of these genes indicate that all have the
    same intron/exon arrangement, Sequences in the promoter regions of the P.
    glaucus CYP6B4v2/CYP6B5v1 genes and the P. polyxenes CYP6B3v2 gene are
    similar but not identical to the -146 to -97 region of CYP6B1v3 gene, which
    contains a xanthotoxin-responsive element (XRE-xan) important for basal and
    xanthotoxin-inducible transcription of CYP6B1v3. Complements of the
    xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE-AhR) in the dioxin-inducible human and
    rat CYP1A1 genes also exist in all four promoters, suggesting that these
    genes may be regulated by dioxin. Antioxidant-responsive elements (AREs) in
    mouse and rat glutathione S-transferase genes and the Barbie box element
    (Bar) in the bacterial CYP102 gene exist in the CYP6B1v3, CYP6B4v2, and
    CYP6B5v1 promoters. Similarities in the protein sequences, intron positions,
    and xanthotoxin- and xenobiotic-responsive promoter elements indicate that
    these insect CYP6B genes are derived from a common ancestral gene.
    Evolutionary comparisons between these P450 genes are the first available
    for a group of insect genes transcriptionally regulated by hostplant
    allelochemicals and provide insights into the process by which insects
    evolve specialized feeding habits.

    Two groups of furanocoumarin-inducible cytochrome P450 genes, the CYP6B4
    group and the CYP6B17 group, characterized in two closely related tiger
    swallowtails, Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis, are induced to
    different extents, with generally higher levels of CYP6B transcripts in P.
    glaucus. To investigate the evolutionary history of these CYP6B genes in the
    context of their association with furanocoumarin detoxification, we isolated
    thirteen CYP6B genes from these species. Each of these genes contains an
    intron at a conserved position (1334 nucleotides from the translation start
    site), which varies in length due to three insertion/deletions. The proximal
    5' end flanking sequence from the transcription initiation site is highly
    conserved (91-98% nt identity). The sequence 5' to -640 is significantly
    variable due largely to the presence of three insertion/deletions. The
    sequence at the 3' end of this region contains a putative xenobiotic
    response element to xanthotoxin (XRE-xan), important for basal and
    xanthotoxin-inducible transcription of the P. polyxenes CYP6B1v3 gene, and
    multiple elements known to regulate vertebrate phase I and II promoters,
    including an XRE-AhR (Xenobiotic Response Element to Aryl hydrocarbon
    Receptor), an OCT-1 element (octamer protein binding site), an ARE
    (Antioxidant Response Element), an EcRE (Ecdysone Response Element), and an
    imperfect PXR (Pregnane X Receptor) responsive element (PRE). Our analyses
    of CYP6B genes in these two species indicate that these genes are in an
    early stage of divergence and that differential exposure of these two
    species to chemically distinct host plants resulting from geographical
    isolation has had functional impacts not only on the coding regions of these
    genes but also on their promoter regions. Thus, changes in P450 regulation
    as well as catalytic activity may play a role in the evolution of host plant
    associations in herbivorous insects.

    The polyphagous corn earworm Helicoverpa zea relies on cytochrome P450
    monooxygenases with broad substrate specificities to cope with the wide
    diversity of phytochemicals it encounters among its numerous host plants.
    These enzymes also contribute to the ability of this insect to tolerate
    toxins from sources other than its hosts, including microbial and synthetic
    toxins. Although upregulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s in some
    herbivorous insects is closely linked to host plant toxins, transcriptional
    and/or post-transcriptional regulation of detoxification in this polyphagous
    species also appears to be relatively unspecialized. Reverse transcription
    polymerase chain reaction and metabolic analyses indicate that rare and
    infrequently encountered phytochemicals, as well as synthetic substances,
    can enhance metabolic activity in an adaptive fashion against both natural
    and synthetic toxins.

    Cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450s) play a critical role in the
    detoxification of natural and synthetic toxins in a wide range of organisms.
    We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding a P-450, CYP6B1, from
    larvae of Papilio polyxenes (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), the black
    swallowtail butterfly. This P-450, cloned from a herbivorous insect, is
    highly inducible by xanthotoxin, a secondary metabolite abundant in the host
    plants of this specialized herbivore. On Northern blots, mRNAs crossreactive
    with CYP6B1 were detected in three Papilio species that, like the black
    swallowtail, have high levels of xanthotoxin-metabolic P-450 activity and
    encounter xanthotoxin or related compounds in their host plants; in
    contrast, no crossreactive mRNAs were detectable in three papilionid species
    that never encounter xanthotoxin in their host plants and lack detectable
    xanthotoxin-metabolic activity. These results provide evidence that new
    P-450s can arise as herbivores colonize different host plants and support
    the hypothesis that interactions between herbivores and their
    toxin-producing host plants have contributed to the diversification of the
    P-450 superfamily.

    The homology model of Papilio polyxenes CYP6B1 places Ile115, one of two
    variable amino acids, in the SRS1 of various CYP6B subfamily proteins in
    close proximity to the heme and Ala113, another variable amino acid, in a
    more distal position. We have constructed mutant CYP6B1 proteins altered at
    either of these positions and homology models of each based on multiple
    alignments with crystallized P450 proteins. The homology models suggest the
    existence of significant structural diversity in the hydrogen bond network
    surrounding the heme as a result of single point mutations in SRS1.
    Mutagenesis of Ile115 or Ala113 to other residues present in the insect
    CYP6B subfamily indicates that these amino acids control the spin state of
    the heme and, as a result, the catalytic activity of this monooxygenase. In
    particular, the I115L mutation significantly increases the spin state of the
    heme coordinately with 2- to 4-fold increases in its turnover of linear
    furanocoumarins. Other A113V, A113L, A113Q, and A113E mutations display more
    variation in their effects but, in each case, strong correlations exist
    between furanocoumarin turnover and heme spin state. These data demonstrate
    that variable amino acids in SRS1 of the insect CYP6B subfamily exert
    dramatic effects on the range of furanocoumarins metabolized, even when they
    occur in positions potentially distal from the substrate. These effects are
    possibly mediated through rearrangement of the local hydrogen bond network.

    Xanthotoxin, a plant allelochemical, induces a-cypermethrin insecticide
    tolerance in Helicoverpa tea (corn earworm); inhibition of tolerance by
    piperonyl butoxide implicates cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) in the
    detoxification of this insecticide. To characterize the
    xanthotoxin-inducible P450 that might mediate a-cypermethrin tolerance in
    this species, a cDNA library prepared from xanthotoxin-induced H. tea fifth
    instar larvae was screened with cDNAs encoding furanocoumarin-metabolizing
    P450s from Papilio polyxenes (CYP6B1 nu 2) and P. glaucus (CYP6B4 nu 2) as
    well as a sequence-related P450 from Helicoverpa armigera (CYP6B2). One
    full-length cDNA isolated in this screening shares 51-99% amino acid
    identity with the CYP6B subfamily of P450s isolated from Papilio and
    Helicoverpa species and, thus, has been designated CYP6B8. All of these
    CYP6B subfamily members share a number of highly conserved domains,
    including substrate recognition site 1 (SRS 1) that is critical for
    xanthotoxin metabolism by CYP6B1v2 from Papilio polyxenes and coumarin
    metabolism by CYP2a5 from Mus musculus. Northern and RT-PCR analyses
    indicate that CYP6B8 expression is strongly induced by xanthotoxin and
    phenobarbital and negligibly induced by alpha-cypermethrin. (C) 2000

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are involved in many cases of resistance of
    insects to insecticides. Resistance has long been associated with an
    increase in monooxygenase activities and with an increase in cytochrome P450
    content. However, this increase does not always account for all of the
    resistance. In Drosophila melanogaster, we have shown that the
    overproduction of cytochrome P450 can be lost by the fly without a
    corresponding complete loss of resistance. These results prompted the
    sequencing of a cytochrome P450 candidate for resistance in resistant and
    susceptible flies. Several mutations leading to amino-acid substitutions
    have been detected in the P450 gene CYP6A2 of a resistant strain. The
    location of these mutations in a model of the 3D structure of the CYP6A2
    protein suggested that some of them may be important for enzyme activity of
    this molecule. This has been verified by heterologous expression of
    wild-type and mutated cDNA in Escherichia coli. When other resistance
    mechanisms are considered, relatively few genetic mutations are involved in
    insecticide resistance, and this has led to an optimistic view of the
    management of resistance. Our observations compel us to survey in more
    detail the genetic diversity of cytochrome P450 genes and alleles involved
    in resistance.

    The InParanoid eukaryotic ortholog database (http://InParanoid.sbc.su.se/)
    has been updated to version 6 and is now based on 35 species. We collected
    all available 'complete' eukaryotic proteomes and Escherichia coli, and
    calculated ortholog groups for all 595 species pairs using the InParanoid
    program. This resulted in 2 642 187 pairwise ortholog groups in total. The
    orthology-based species relations are presented in an orthophylogram.
    InParanoid clusters contain one or more orthologs from each of the two
    species. Multiple orthologs in the same species, i.e. inparalogs, result
    from gene duplications after the species divergence. A new InParanoid
    website has been developed which is optimized for speed both for users and
    for updating the system. The XML output format has been improved for
    efficient processing of the InParanoid ortholog clusters.

    About 2000 completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes are available from the
    NCBI RefSeq data base together with manually curated annotations of their
    protein-coding genes, rRNAs, and tRNAs. This annotation information, which
    has accumulated over two decades, has been obtained with a diverse set of
    computational tools and annotation strategies. Despite all efforts of manual
    curation it is still plagued by misassignments of reading directions,
    erroneous gene names, and missing as well as false positive annotations in
    particular for the RNA genes. Taken together, this causes substantial
    problems for fully automatic pipelines that aim to use these data
    comprehensively for studies of animal phylogenetics and the molecular
    evolution of mitogenomes. The MITOS pipeline is designed to compute a
    consistent de novo annotation of the mitogenomic sequences. We show that the
    results of MITOS match RefSeq and MitoZoa in terms of annotation coverage
    and quality. At the same time we avoid biases, inconsistencies of
    nomenclature, and typos originating from manual curation strategies. The
    MITOS pipeline is accessible online at http://mitos.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de.

    Local translation of asymmetrically enriched mRNAs is a powerful mechanism
    for functional polarization of the cell. In Drosophila, exclusive
    accumulation of Oskar protein at the posterior pole of the oocyte is
    essential for development of the future embryo. This is achieved by the
    formation of a dynamic oskar ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex regulating the
    transport of oskar mRNA, its translational repression while unlocalized, and
    its translational activation upon arrival at the posterior pole. We
    identified the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein PTB ( polypyrimidine
    tract-binding protein)/hnRNP I as a new factor associating with the oskar
    RNP in vivo. While PTB function is largely dispensable for oskar mRNA
    transport, it is necessary for translational repression of the localizing
    mRNA. Unexpectedly, a cytoplasmic form of PTB can associate with oskar mRNA
    and repress its translation, suggesting that nuclear recruitment of PTB to
    oskar complexes is not required for its regulatory function. Furthermore,
    PTB binds directly to multiple sites along the oskar 39 untranslated region
    and mediates assembly of high-order complexes containing multiple oskar RNA
    molecules in vivo. Thus, PTB is a key structural component of oskar RNP
    complexes that dually controls formation of high-order RNP particles and
    translational silencing.

    Haplodiploid organisms comprise about 20% of animals. Males develop from
    unfertilized eggs while females are derived from fertilized eggs. The
    underlying mechanisms of sex determination, however, appear to be diverse
    and are poorly understood. We have dissected the complementary sex
    determiner (csd) locus in the honeybee to understand its molecular basis. In
    this species, csd acts as the primary sex-determining signal with several
    alleles segregating in populations. Males are hemizygous and females are
    heterozygous at this locus; nonreproducing diploid males occur when the
    locus is homozygous. We have characterized csd by positional cloning and
    repression analysis. csd alleles are highly variable and no transcription
    differences were found between sexes. These results establish csd as a
    primary signal that governs sexual development by its allelic composition.
    Structural similarity of csd with tra genes of Dipteran insects suggests
    some functional relation of what would otherwise appear to be unrelated
    sex-determination mechanisms.

    Recent advances in RNA-seq methodologies from limiting amounts of mRNA have
    facilitated the characterization of rare cell-types in various biological
    systems. So far, however, technical variations in these methods have not
    been adequately characterized, vis-à-vis sensitivity, starting with reduced
    levels of mRNA. Here, we generated sequencing libraries from limiting
    amounts of mRNA using three amplification-based methods, viz. Smart-seq,
    DP-seq and CEL-seq, and demonstrated significant technical variations in
    these libraries. Reduction in mRNA levels led to inefficient amplification
    of the majority of low to moderately expressed transcripts. Furthermore,
    noise in primer hybridization and/or enzyme incorporation was magnified
    during the amplification step resulting in significant distortions in fold
    changes of the transcripts. Consequently, the majority of the differentially
    expressed transcripts identified were either high-expressed and/or exhibited
    high fold changes. High technical variations ultimately masked subtle
    biological differences mandating the development of improved
    amplification-based strategies for quantitative transcriptomics from
    limiting amounts of mRNA.

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases or CYPs, a family of endobiotics and
    xenobiotics metabolizing enzymes, are found in all organisms. We reported
    earlier that the promoters of Drosophila Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes are induced
    by caffeine. Since caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptor (AdoR) and
    inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase (I'DE), we used luciferase reporter gene to
    examine whether in SL-2 cells and adult Drosophila, induction of the two
    Cyp6 genes is mediated via AdoR and/or PDE pathway. Results showed that AdoR
    is not involved because AdoR agonists or antagonists do not affect the Cyp6
    promoter activities. However, inhibition of PDE by specific inhibitors
    including caffeine causes induction of both Cyp6 gene promoters. We also
    found that flies mutant for dunce gene coding for cAMP-PDE, have higher
    CypGa8 promoter activity than the wild-type flies. We demonstrate that
    caffeine treatment increases intracellular cAMP levels, and cAMP treatment
    induces the Cyp6 gene promoters. Since both CypG genes have multiple sites
    for JUN transcription factors, which generally play a positive role in cAMP
    pathway, effect of Drosophila jun (D-jun) on the Cyp6a8 promoter activity
    was examined. Results showed that the expression of D-jun sense plasmid
    causes downregulation rather than activation of the Cyp6a8 promoter.
    Conversely, expression of antisense plasmid increased the promoter activity.
    Interestingly, caffeine treatment decreased the D-JUN protein level in SL-2
    cells as well as in adult flies. These results suggest that D-jun acts as a
    negative regulator, and caffeine induction of Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a2 genes is
    mediated by the upregulation of cAMP pathway and downregulation of the D-JUN
    protein level. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

    We describe a method that adds long-read sequencing to a mix of technologies
    used to assemble a highly complex cattle rumen microbial community, and
    provide a comparison to short read-based methods. Long-read alignments and
    Hi-C linkage between contigs support the identification of 188 novel
    virus-host associations and the determination of phage life cycle states in
    the rumen microbial community. The long-read assembly also identifies 94
    antimicrobial resistance genes, compared to only seven alleles in the
    short-read assembly. We demonstrate novel techniques that work
    synergistically to improve characterization of biological features in a
    highly complex rumen microbial community.

  abstract: >-
    Carboxylesterases constitute a large enzyme family in insects, which is
    involved in diverse functions such as xenobiotic detoxification, lipid
    metabolism and reproduction. Phylogenetically, many insect carboxylesterases
    are represented by multienzyme clades, which are encoded by evolutionarily
    ancient gene clusters such as the α-Esterase cluster. Much in contrast to
    the vital importance attributed to carboxylesterases in general, the in vivo
    function of individual α-Esterase genes is largely unknown. This study
    employs a functional proteomics approach to identify esterolytic enzymes of
    the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster fat body. One of the fat body
    carboxylesterases, α-Esterase-7, was selected for mutational analysis by
    gene targeting to generate a deletion mutant fly. Phenotypic
    characterization of α-Esterase-7 null mutants and transgenic flies, which
    overexpress a chimeric α-Esterase-7:EGFP gene, reveals important functions
    of α-Esterase-7 in insecticide tolerance, lipid metabolism and lifespan
    control. The presented first deletion mutant of any α-Esterase in the model
    insect D. melanogaster generated by gene targeting not only provides
    experimental evidence for the endogenous functions of this gene family. It
    also offers an entry point for in vivo structure-function analyses of
    α-Esterase-7, which is of central importance for naturally occurring
    insecticide resistance in wild populations of various dipteran insect
    species.

    Germ-line transformation via transposable elements is a powerful tool to
    study gene function in Drosophila melanogaster. However, some inherent
    characteristics of transposon-mediated transgenesis limit its use for
    transgene analysis. Here, we circumvent these limitations by optimizing a
    φC31-based integration system. We generated a collection of lines with
    precisely mapped attP sites that allow the insertion of transgenes into many
    different predetermined intergenic locations throughout the fly genome. By
    using regulatory elements of the nanos and vasa genes, we established
    endogenous sources of the φC31 integrase, eliminating the difficulties of
    coinjecting integrase mRNA and raising the transformation efficiency.
    Moreover, to discriminate between specific and rare nonspecific integration
    events, a white gene-based reconstitution system was generated that enables
    visual selection for precise attP targeting. Finally, we demonstrate that
    our chromosomal attP sites can be modified in situ, extending their scope
    while retaining their properties as landing sites. The efficiency,
    ease-of-use, and versatility obtained here with the φC31-based integration
    system represents an important advance in transgenesis and opens up the
    possibility of systematic, high-throughput screening of large cDNA sets and
    regulatory elements.

    Many of the biochemical conversions in plant steroid hormone biosynthesis
    are catalysed by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs or P450s). A recent paper by
    Toshiyuki Ohnishi et al. (2006) indicates the role of CYP90C1 and CYP90D1 in
    the synthesis of the most bioactive plant steroid hormone, brassinolide.
    These results highlight the need for refining the brassinolide biosynthesis
    pathway.

  abstract: >-
    Dietary restriction extends lifespan and retards age-related disease in many
    species and profoundly alters endocrine function in mammals. However, no
    causal role of any hormonal signal in diet-restricted longevity has been
    demonstrated. Here we show that increased longevity of diet-restricted
    Caenorhabditis elegans requires the transcription factor gene skn-1 acting
    in the ASIs, a pair of neurons in the head. Dietary restriction activates
    skn-1 in these two neurons, which signals peripheral tissues to increase
    metabolic activity. These findings demonstrate that increased lifespan in a
    diet-restricted metazoan depends on cell non-autonomous signalling from
    central neuronal cells to non-neuronal body tissues, and suggest that the
    ASI neurons mediate diet-restriction-induced longevity by an endocrine
    mechanism.

    The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a major nutrient-sensing pathway
    that, when genetically downregulated, increases life span in evolutionarily
    diverse organisms including mammals. The central component of this pathway,
    TOR kinase, is the target of the inhibitory drug rapamycin, a highly
    specific and well-described drug approved for human use. We show here that
    feeding rapamycin to adult Drosophila produces the life span extension seen
    in some TOR mutants. Increase in life span by rapamycin was associated with
    increased resistance to both starvation and paraquat. Analysis of the
    underlying mechanisms revealed that rapamycin increased longevity
    specifically through the TORC1 branch of the TOR pathway, through
    alterations to both autophagy and translation. Rapamycin could increase life
    span of weak insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway mutants and of flies with
    life span maximized by dietary restriction, indicating additional
    mechanisms.

  abstract: >-
    Ecdysteroids are polyhyclroxylated steroids that function as molting
    hormones in insects. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (a 27C-ecdysteroid) is classically
    considered as the major steroid hormone of Drosophila melanogaster, but this
    insect also contains 28C-ecdysteroids. This arises from both the use of
    several dietary sterols as precursors for the synthesis of its steroid
    hormones, and its inability to dealkylate the 28C-phytosterols to produce
    cholesterol. The nature of Drosophila ecdysteroids has been re-investigated
    using both high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to enzyme
    immunoassay and a particularly sensitive nano-liquid chromatography-mass
    spectrometry methodology, while taking advantage of recently available
    ecdysteroid standards isolated from plants. in vitro incubations of the
    larval steroidogenic organ, the ring-gland, reveals the synthesis of
    ecdysone, 20-deoxy-makisterone A and a third less polar compound identified
    as the 24-epimer of the latter, while wandering larvae contain the three
    corresponding 20-hydroxylated ecdysteroids. This pattern results from the
    simultaneous use of higher plant sterols (from maize) and fungal sterols
    (from yeast). The physiological relevance of all these ecdysteroids, which
    display different affinities to the ecdysteroid receptors, is still a matter
    of debate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract: >-
    Lufenuron is an insect growth regulator insecticide mainly used for the
    control of the cat flea. To understand mechanisms of resistance to
    lufenuron, we have characterized lufenuron resistance in a natural
    population of Drosophila melanogaster. In this study we have used precise
    genetic mapping to identify a mechanism of lufenuron resistance: the
    overexpression of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp12a4. Cyp12a4 is predicted to
    encode a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme. Expression of Cyp12a4 in D.
    melanogaster third-instar larvae was detected in the midgut and Malpighian
    tubules of both lufenuron-resistant and wild-type strains. The level of
    Cyp12a4 expression in the midgut is higher in the lufenuron-resistant strain
    than in wild-type strains. Driving the expression of Cyp12a4 in the midgut
    and Malpighian tubules by using the GAL4/UAS gene expression system results
    in lufenuron resistance, but it does not result in resistance to three other
    insecticide classes. Transgenic expression of Cyp12a4 in a ubiquitous
    expression pattern results in late embryonic lethality, suggesting that
    high-level ectopic expression of Cyp12a4 is detrimental to development.

    Isofemale strains of Drosophila melanogaster were established from single
    inseminated females collected from populations along the east coast of
    Australia. Strains were tested for resistance to the organophosphorus
    insecticide diazinon at larval and/or adult stages of the life cycle.
    Considerable phenotypic variation was observed within and between population
    samples but there was no association between collection site of a sample and
    resistance status. Adult and larval resistance levels were uncorrelated.
    Resistance levels in adults were low (2-fold) and polygenically based.
    Larval resistance levels, due to single genes ( or gene complexes) on
    chromosomes II and III, were significant (15-fold). Evidence indicates that
    the gene on chromosome II is Cyp6g1.

    Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation is one of the primary goals of
    evolutionary biology. The evolution of xenobiotic resistance in insects has
    proven to be an especially suitable arena for studying the genetics of
    adaptation, and resistant phenotypes are known to result from both coding
    and regulatory changes. In this study, we examine the evolutionary history
    and population genetics of two Drosophila mettleri cytochrome P450 genes
    that are putatively involved in the detoxification of alkaloids present in
    two of its cactus hosts: saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and senita
    (Lophocereus schottii). Previous studies demonstrated that Cyp28A1 was
    highly up-regulated following exposure to rotting senita tissue while
    Cyp4D10 was highly up-regulated following exposure to rotting saguaro
    tissue. Here, we show that a subset of sites in Cyp28A1 experienced adaptive
    evolution specifically in the D. mettleri lineage. Moreover, neutrality
    tests in several populations were also consistent with a history of
    selection on Cyp28A1. In contrast, we did not find evidence for positive
    selection on Cyp4D10, although this certainly does not preclude its
    involvement in host plant use. A surprising result that emerged from our
    population genetic analyses was the presence of significant genetic
    differentiation between flies collected from different host plant species
    (saguaro and senita) at Organ Pipe National Monument, Arizona, USA. This
    preliminary evidence suggests that D. mettleri may have evolved into
    distinctive host races that specialize on different hosts, a possibility
    that warrants further investigation.

    Viruses are trifurcated into eukaryotic, archaeal and bacterial categories.
    This domain-specific ecology underscores why eukaryotic viruses typically
    co-opt eukaryotic genes and bacteriophages commonly harbour bacterial genes.
    However, the presence of bacteriophages in obligate intracellular bacteria
    of eukaryotes may promote DNA transfers between eukaryotes and
    bacteriophages. Here we report a metagenomic analysis of purified
    bacteriophage WO particles of Wolbachia and uncover a eukaryotic association
    module in the complete WO genome. It harbours predicted domains, such as the
    black widow latrotoxin C-terminal domain, that are uninterrupted in
    bacteriophage genomes, enriched with eukaryotic protease cleavage sites and
    combined with additional domains to forge one of the largest bacteriophage
    genes to date (14,256 bp). To the best of our knowledge, these
    eukaryotic-like domains have never before been reported in packaged
    bacteriophages and their phylogeny, distribution and sequence diversity
    imply lateral transfers between bacteriophage/prophage and animal genomes.
    Finally, the WO genome sequences and identification of attachment sites will
    potentially advance genetic manipulation of Wolbachia., 

    Viruses commonly exchange genetic material with their hosts, but not with
    species from other domains of life. Here, the authors find that the
    bacteriophage WO of Wolbachia contains eukaryotic-like genes, implicating
    lateral genetic transfer between eukaryotes and viruses infecting bacteria.

  abstract: >-
    The early expression of the Drosophila segment polarity gene gooseberry
    (gsb) is under the control of the pair-rule genes. We have identified a
    514-bp enhancer which reproduces the early gsb expression pattern in
    transgenic flies. The transcription factor Paired (Prd) is the main
    activator of this enhancer in all parasegments of the embryo. It binds to
    paired- and homeodomain-binding sites, which are segregated on the enhancer.
    Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified sites critical for Prd
    activity. Negative regulation of this enhancer is mediated by the
    Even-skipped protein (Eve) in the odd-numbered parasegments and by the
    combination of Fushi-tarazu (Ftz) and Odd-skipped proteins in the
    even-numbered parasegments. The organisation of the Prd-binding sites, as
    well as the necessity for intact DNA binding sites for both paired- and
    homeodomains, suggests a molecular model whereby the two DNA-binding domains
    of the Prd protein cooperate in transcriptional activation of gsb. This
    positive activity appears to be in competition with Eve and Ftz on Prd
    homeodomain-binding sites.

  abstract: >-
    Diatoms are photosynthetic secondary endosymbionts found throughout marine
    and freshwater environments, and are believed to be responsible for around
    one-fifth of the primary productivity on Earth. The genome sequence of the
    marine centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was recently reported,
    revealing a wealth of information about diatom biology. Here we report the
    complete genome sequence of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and
    compare it with that of T. pseudonana to clarify evolutionary origins,
    functional significance and ubiquity of these features throughout diatoms.
    In spite of the fact that the pennate and centric lineages have only been
    diverging for 90 million years, their genome structures are dramatically
    different and a substantial fraction of genes ( approximately 40%) are not
    shared by these representatives of the two lineages. Analysis of molecular
    divergence compared with yeasts and metazoans reveals rapid rates of gene
    diversification in diatoms. Contributing factors include selective gene
    family expansions, differential losses and gains of genes and introns, and
    differential mobilization of transposable elements. Most significantly, we
    document the presence of hundreds of genes from bacteria. More than 300 of
    these gene transfers are found in both diatoms, attesting to their ancient
    origins, and many are likely to provide novel possibilities for metabolite
    management and for perception of environmental signals. These findings go a
    long way towards explaining the incredible diversity and success of the
    diatoms in contemporary oceans.

  abstract: >-
    Although mammalian sex is determined genetically, the sex-specific
    development of germ cells as sperm or oocytes is initiated by cues provided
    by the gonadal environment. During embryogenesis, germ cells in an ovary
    enter meiosis, thereby committing to oogenesis. By contrast, germ cells in a
    testicular environment do not enter meiosis until puberty. Recent findings
    indicate that the key to this sex- specific timing of meiosis entry is the
    presence or absence of the signaling molecule retinoic acid. Although this
    knowledge clarifies a long- standing mystery in reproductive biology, it
    also poses many new questions, which we discuss in this review.

  abstract: >-
    Germ cells in the mouse embryo can develop as oocytes or spermatogonia,
    depending on molecular cues that have not been identified. We found that
    retinoic acid, produced by mesonephroi of both sexes, causes germ cells in
    the ovary to enter meiosis and inititate oogenesis. Meiosis is retarded in
    the fetal testis by the action of the retinoid-degrading enzyme CYP26B1,
    ultimately leading to spermatogenesis. In testes of Cyp26b1-knockout mouse
    embryos, germ cells enter meiosis precociously, as if in a normal ovary.
    Thus, precise regulation of retinoid levels during fetal gonad development
    provides the molecular control mechanism that specifies germ cell fate.

    We describe the effects of four recessive homeotic mutations that
    specifically disrupt the development of flowers in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    Each of the recessive mutations affects the outcome of organ development,
    but not the location of organ primordia. Homeotic transformations observed
    are as follows. In agamous-1, stamens to petals; in apetala2-1, sepals to
    leaves and petals to staminoid petals; in apetala3-1, petals to sepals and
    stamens to carpels; in pistillata-1, petals to sepals. In addition, two of
    these mutations (ap2-1 and pi-1) result in loss of organs, and ag-1 causes
    the cells that would ordinarily form the gynoecium to differentiate as a
    flower. Two of the mutations are temperature-sensitive. Temperature shift
    experiments indicate that the wild-type AP2 gene product acts at the time of
    primordium initiation; the AP3 product is active later. It seems that the
    wild-type alleles of these four genes allow cells to determine their place
    in the developing flower and thus to differentiate appropriately. We propose
    that these genes may be involved in setting up or responding to concentric,
    overlapping fields within the flower primordium.

    We describe allelic series for three loci, mutations in which result in
    homeotic conversions in two adjacent whorls in the Arabidopsis thaliana
    flower. Both the structure of the mature flower and its development from the
    initial primordium are described by scanning electron microscopy. New
    mutations at the APETALA2 locus, ap2-2, ap2-8 and ap2-9, cause homeotic
    conversions in the outer two whorls: sepals to carpels (or leaves) and
    petals to stamens. Two new mutations of PISTILLATA, pi-2 and pi-3, cause
    second and third whorl organs to differentiate incorrectly. Homeotic
    conversions are petals to sepals and stamens to carpels, a pattern similar
    to that previously described for the apetala3-1 mutation. The AGAMOUS
    mutations, ag-2 and ag-3, affect the third and fourth whorls and cause
    petals to develop instead of stamens and another flower to arise in place of
    the gynoecium. In addition to homeotic changes, mutations at the APETALA2,
    APETALA3 and PISTILLATA loci may lead to reduced numbers of organs, or even
    their absence, in specific whorls. The bud and flower phenotypes of doubly
    and triply mutant strains, constructed with these and previously described
    alleles, are also described. Based on these results, a model is proposed
    that suggests that the products of these homeotic genes are each active in
    fields occupying two adjacent whorls, AP2 in the two outer whorls, PI and
    AP3 in whorls two and three, and AG in the two inner whorls. In combination,
    therefore, the gene products in these three concentric, overlapping fields
    specify the four types of organs in the wild-type flower. Further, the
    phenotypes of multiple mutant lines indicate that the wild-type products of
    the AGAMOUS and APETALA2 genes interact antagonistically. AP2 seems to keep
    the AG gene inactive in the two outer whorls while the converse is likely in
    the two inner whorls. This field model successfully predicts the phenotypes
    of all the singly, doubly and triply mutant flowers described.

    In most primitively eusocial wasps new nests are initiated by a single
    female or by small groups of females. To study the emergence of division of
    labor (DOL) among the nest foundresses and to determine its possible effect
    on nest productivity we maintained newly eclosed females of Ropalidia
    marginata in small boxes with one, two, or three nestmate wasps of the same
    age per box. Only one wasp developed her ovaries and laid eggs in each box,
    while the other wasp(s) built the nest, brought food, and fed larvae,
    demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of reproductive DOL in the presence
    of more than one wasp. In nests with three wasps there was also a strong
    negative correlation between intranidal and extranidal work performed by the
    two nonreproductive workers, suggesting the spontaneous emergence of
    nonreproductive DOL; such nonreproductive DOL was absent in nests with two
    wasps. Both reproductive and nonreproductive DOL were modulated by dominance
    behavior (DB). In nests with two wasps the egg layer showed significantly
    more DB than the non-egg layer before nest initiation; in nests with three
    wasps queens showed significantly more DB than intranidal workers, which in
    turn showed significantly more DB than extranidal workers. Productivities of
    nests (as measured by total brood on the day of eclosion of the first adult)
    initiated by one or two wasps were not different from each other but were
    significantly lower than that of three wasps. Thus, nonreproductive DOL, and
    not merely reproductive DOL, is necessary for increase in productivity.

    We have designed a system for targeted gene expression that allows the
    selective activation of any cloned gene in a wide variety of tissue- and
    cell-specific patterns. The gene encoding the yeast transcriptional
    activator GAL4 is inserted randomly into the Drosophila genome to drive GAL4
    expression from one of a diverse array of genomic enhancers. It is then
    possible to introduce a gene containing GAL4 binding sites within its
    promoter, to activate it in those cells where GAL4 is expressed, and to
    observe the effect of this directed misexpression on development. We have
    used GAL4-directed transcription to expand the domain of embryonic
    expression of the homeobox protein even-skipped. We show that even-skipped
    represses wingless and transforms cells that would normally secrete naked
    cuticle into denticle secreting cells. The GAL4 system can thus be used to
    study regulatory interactions during embryonic development. In adults,
    targeted expression can be used to generate dominant phenotypes for use in
    genetic screens. We have directed expression of an activated form of the
    Dras2 protein, resulting in dominant eye and wing defects that can be used
    in screens to identify other members of the Dras2 signal transduction
    pathway.

    Previous studies have shown that the major metabolic resistance locus in the
    insecticide-resistant Drosophila line Rst(2)DDTWisconsin maps between the
    markers cn and vg on chromosome 2. Six cytochrome P450 genes exist in this
    region. We investigated the expression levels of these P450 genes in
    DDT-resistant and -susceptible fly lines. We report: (1) DDT resistance is
    significant (> 30-fold) and dominant, (ii) resistance is reduced by the
    cytochrome P450 inhibitor PBO, (iii) there is constitutive over-expression
    relative to susceptible flies of two genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes
    within the cn-vg region (CYP6G1 = 4.3-fold; CYP12D1 = 6.0-fold), and (iv)
    exposure to DDT results in an increased expression of only one of these two
    P450 genes (CYP12D1 greater than or equal to6-fold above constitutive
    resistant fly baselines).

  abstract: "Summary\nThe stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse lineage of hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described species and a diversity of life history traits, including ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation, pollen feeding (bees [Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid wasps, ants, and some bees) [1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4–11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5–7]. We used ultraconserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from &gt;800\_UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a\_paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference."

  abstract: >-
    The bicoid stability factor (BSF) of Drosophila melanogaster has been
    reported to be present in the cytoplasm, where it stabilizes the maternally
    contributed bicoid mRNA and binds mRNAs expressed from early zygotic genes.
    BSF may also have other roles, as it is ubiquitously expressed and essential
    for survival of adult flies. We have performed immunofluorescence and cell
    fractionation analyses and show here that BSF is mainly a mitochondrial
    protein. We studied two independent RNAi knockdown fly lines and report that
    reduced BSF protein levels lead to a severe respiratory deficiency and
    delayed development at the late larvae stage. Ubiquitous knockdown of BSF
    results in a severe reduction of the polyadenylation tail lengths of
    specific mitochondrial mRNAs, accompanied by an enrichment of unprocessed
    polycistronic RNA intermediates. Furthermore, we observed a significant
    reduction in mRNA steady state levels, despite increased de novo
    transcription. Surprisingly, mitochondrial de novo translation is increased
    and abnormal mitochondrial translation products are present in knockdown
    flies, suggesting that BSF also has a role in coordinating the mitochondrial
    translation in addition to its role in mRNA maturation and stability. We
    thus report a novel function of BSF in flies and demonstrate that it has an
    important intra-mitochondrial role, which is essential for maintaining mtDNA
    gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation.

    Good Calories, Bad Calories has much useful information and is well worth
    reading. Gary Taubes's tenets related to obesity can be summarized in four
    statements (i) He believes that you can gain weight and become obese without
    a positive energy balance; (ii) He also believes that dietary fat is
    unimportant for the development of obesity; (iii) Carbohydrate, in his view,
    is what produces obesity and (iv) Insulin secreted by the carbohydrate is
    the problem in obesity. However, some of the conclusions that the author
    reaches are not consistent with current concepts about obesity. There are
    many kinds of obesity, and only some depend on diet composition. Two dietary
    manipulations produce obesity in susceptible people: eating a high-fat diet
    and drinking sugar- or high-fructose corn syrup-sweetened beverages. Insulin
    is necessary but not sufficient in the diet-dependent obesities. When diet
    is important, it may be the combination of fat and fructose (the deadly duo)
    that is most important. Regardless of diet, it is a positive energy balance
    over months to years that is the sine qua non for obesity. Obese people
    clearly eat more than do lean ones, and food-intake records are notoriously
    unreliable, as documented by use of doubly labelled water. Underreporting of
    food intake is greater in obese than in normal-weight people and is worse
    for fat than for other macronutrient groups. Accepting the concept that
    obesity results from a positive energy balance does not tell us why energy
    balance is positive. This depends on a variety of environmental factors
    interacting with the genetic susceptibility of certain individuals. Weight
    loss is related to adherence to the diet, not to its macronutrient
    composition.

  abstract: >-
    A small number of signalling pathways are used iteratively to regulate cell
    fates, cell proliferation and cell death in development. Notch is the
    receptor in one such pathway, and is unusual in that most of its ligands are
    also transmembrane proteins; therefore signalling is restricted to
    neighbouring cells. Although the intracellular transduction of the Notch
    signal is remarkably simple, with no secondary messengers, this pathway
    functions in an enormous diversity of developmental processes and its
    dysfunction is implicated in many cancers.

    False-positive identifications are a significant problem in metagenomics
    classification. We present KrakenUniq, a novel metagenomics classifier that
    combines the fast k-mer-based classification of Kraken with an efficient
    algorithm for assessing the coverage of unique k-mers found in each species
    in a dataset. On various test datasets, KrakenUniq gives better recall and
    precision than other methods and effectively classifies and distinguishes
    pathogens with low abundance from false positives in infectious disease
    samples. By using the probabilistic cardinality estimator HyperLogLog,
    KrakenUniq runs as fast as Kraken and requires little additional memory.

    Cell proliferation, cell death, and pattern formation are coordinated in
    animal development. Although many proteins that control cell proliferation
    and apoptosis have been identified, the means by which these effectors are
    linked to the patterning machinery remain poorly understood. Here, we report
    that the bantam gene of Drosophila encodes a 21 nucleotide microRNA that
    promotes tissue growth. bantam expression is temporally and spatially
    regulated in response to patterning cues. bantam microRNA simultaneously
    stimulates cell proliferation and prevents apoptosis. We identify the
    pro-apoptotic gene hid as a target for regulation by bantam miRNA, providing
    an explanation for bantam's anti-apoptotic activity.

    This article discusses the role of grasslands and their products in the
    development of empire between 1850 and 1930. It explores the paradox that,
    despite the significance of introduced grasslands in terms of environmental
    transformation and imperial trade, most contemporary observers ignored this
    or took it for granted as, generally, have today's historians of empire. The
    article charts relations between grassland development, improvement and
    empire building, and examines how retrieval of this neglected story might
    encourage reconceptualisation of empire relationships, focusing particularly
    on those between New Zealand and Britain.

  abstract: >-
    The cardiac glycosides that monarch butterflies sequester from milkweed
    plants during the larval stage differ remarkably in their emetic potency and
    are concentrated to different degrees in the various parts of the body as
    well as in the two sexes (Fig. 1). The very high concentrations of these
    compounds in the wings probably facilitate learned taste rejection in
    predators and account for the relatively high frequency of Danaid
    butterflies with beak-marked wings in natural populations. The cardiac
    glycosides in the abdomen have a much higher emetic potency than those in
    the rest of the body. Consequently, naive, extremely hungry, or forgetful
    birds which capture and peck off the wings but eat the abdomen discard the
    least emetic glycosides and ingest the most emetic, and thus again
    experience emesis. The nonrandom distribution of cardenolides in the wings,
    abdomen, and thorax, together with the fact that monarch males not only
    contain lower concentrations of cardiac glycosides than females but also
    contain cardenolides that are overall less emetic than those in females, is
    interpreted as evidence that these poisons are incorporated at a
    physiological cost. This cost, balanced against the benefits of protection
    from predation, provides a selective basis for the occurrence of both emetic
    and nonemetic individuals in natural populations. Since birds can
    discriminate emetic from nonemetic monarchs on the basis of taste, it is not
    necessary to invoke theories of kind of group selection to explain the
    evolution of this kind of unpalatability.

    Deep shotgun sequencing and analysis of genomes, transcriptomes, amplified
    single-cell genomes, and metagenomes has enabled investigation of a wide
    range of organisms and ecosystems. However, sampling variation in short-read
    data sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many
    new computational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have
    led to the development of new classes of mapping tools and {\em de novo}
    assemblers. These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in
    sequencing throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass
    computational algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing
    data sets, thereby decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data,
    and removing the majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially
    reduces the size of shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time
    requirements for {\em de novo} sequence assembly, all without significantly
    impacting content of the generated contigs. We apply digital normalization
    to the assembly of microbial genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic
    data, and transcriptomic data. Our implementation is freely available for
    use and modification.

    UV-B radiation in sunlight has diverse effects on humans, animals, plants,
    and microorganisms. UV-B can cause damage to molecules and cells, and
    consequently organisms need to protect against and repair UV damage to
    survive in sunlight. In plants, low nondamaging levels of UV-B stimulate
    transcription of genes involved in UV-protective responses. However,
    remarkably little is known about the underlying mechanisms of UV-B
    perception and signal transduction. Here we report that Arabidopsis UV
    RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) is a UV-B-specific signaling component that
    orchestrates expression of a range of genes with vital UV-protective
    functions. Moreover, we show that UVR8 regulates expression of the
    transcription factor HY5 specifically when the plant is exposed to UV-B. We
    demonstrate that HY5 is a key effector of the UVR8 pathway, and that it is
    required for survival under UV-B radiation. UVR8 has sequence similarity to
    the eukaryotic guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1, but we found that it
    has little exchange activity. However, UVR8, like RCC1, is located
    principally in the nucleus and associates with chromatin via histones.
    Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that UVR8 associates with chromatin in
    the HY5 promoter region, providing a mechanistic basis for its involvement
    in regulating transcription. We conclude that UVR8 defines a UV-B-specific
    signaling pathway in plants that orchestrates the protective gene expression
    responses to UV-B required for plant survival in sunlight.

    BACKGROUND: Resistance to the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin has been a
    growing problem in the management of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) pest
    populations in West Africa. Detoxification by P450 enzymes appears to be a
    major mechanism of resistance, but the genes responsible for resistance are
    unknown.RESULTS: First, it was shown that deltamethrin resistance in strains
    from Burkina Faso (Kaya) and from Spain (Seville) were suppressible by
    piperonyl butoxide and by trichlorophenyl propynyl ether, thus indicating a
    major role of P450 enzyme(s) in resistance. The larval expression of 21 CYP
    genes encoding P450 enzymes from six CYP families were then compared by
    quantitative RT-PCR. Five genes, CYP4L5,CYP4L11, CYP6AE11, CYP332A1 and
    CYP9A74, were significantly overexpressed in the Kaya and Seville strains
    when compared with He liar, a susceptible strain. Significant overexpression
    of multiple CYP genes (CYP4M6, CYP4M7, CYP6AE11, CYP9A12, CYP332A1 and
    CYP337B1) was also found in six field strains with different levels of
    resistance from Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali.CONCLUSION: Although functional
    or genetic evidence for the role of these P450s in resistance remains to be
    formally established, results suggest that multiple P450 enzymes contribute
    to deltamethrin resistance. This study is a first step towards the
    development of molecular tools for the detection of P450-based resistance in
    H. armigera. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry

    The importance of cytochrome P450s in the biology of cells or organisms is
    clearly established, While numerous studies concern vertebrates, little is
    known about invertebrates cytochrome P450s. In this paper, we have focused
    on CYP6A2 gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. We show the expression
    of this cytochrome P450 gene in the Canton(S) strain (wild type) to be under
    the control of phenobarbital, In adults treated with phenobarbital, this
    gene is transcribed in the midgut, the pericuticular fat bodies and the
    Malpighian tubules. The induction factor is 15. In the RDDT(R) strain of
    Drosophila melanogaster, which is resistant to the insecticide DDT, this
    gene is constitutively overexpressed in the same tissues (overexpression
    factor is 6 relative to untreated Canton(S) flies), Phenobarbital is not as
    effective on RDDT(R) (induction factor is 2.5 relative to untreated RDDT(R)
    dies) as on wild type strains. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

    Septic injury triggers a rapid and widespread response in Drosophila adults
    that involves the up-regulation of many genes required to combat infection
    and for wound healing. Genome-wide expression profiling has already
    demonstrated that this response is controlled by signaling through the Toll,
    Imd, JAK-STAT and JNK pathways. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we now
    demonstrate that the MAPKKK Mekk1 regulates a small subset of genes induced
    by septic injury including Turandot (Tot) stress genes. Our analysis
    indicates that Tot genes show a complex regulation pattern including signals
    from both the JAK-STAT and Imd pathways and Mekk1. Interestingly, Mekk1
    flies are resistant to microbial infection but susceptible to paraquat, an
    inducer of oxidative stress. These results point to a role of Mekk1 in the
    protection against tissue damage and/or protein degradation and indicate
    complex interactions between stress and immune pathways in Drosophila.

    Although the gut is a central organ of Eumetazoans and is essential for
    organismal health, our understanding of its morphological and molecular
    determinants remains rudimentary. Here, we provide a comprehensive atlas of
    Drosophila adult midgut. Specifically, we uncover a fine-grained regional
    organization consisting of 14 subregions with distinct morphological,
    histological, and genetic properties. We also show that Drosophila
    intestinal regionalization is defined after adult emergence, remains stable
    throughout life, and reestablishes following acute tissue damage.
    Additionally, we show that this midgut compartmentalization is achieved
    through the interplay between pan-midgut and regionalized transcription
    factors, in concert with spatial activities of morphogens. Interestingly,
    disruption of the midgut compartmentalization leads to a loss of intestinal
    homeostasis characterized by an increase in stem cell proliferation and
    aberrant immune responses. Our integrative analysis of Drosophila midgut
    compartmentalization provides insights into the conserved mechanisms
    underlying intestinal regionalization in metazoans.

    We describe an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing
    (ATAC-seq), based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors
    into native chromatin, as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative
    epigenomic analysis. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple
    two-step protocol with 500–50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between
    genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual
    nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. We discovered
    classes of DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided, could tolerate or
    tended to overlap with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq maps of human CD4+ T
    cells from a proband obtained on consecutive days, we demonstrated the
    feasibility of analyzing an individual's epigenome on a timescale compatible
    with clinical decision-making.

    This book will give an overview of insect ovaries, showing the diversities
    and the common traits in egg growth processes. The idea to write this book
    developed while looking at the flood of information which appeared in the
    early 1980s on early pattern formation in Drosophila embryos. At this time a
    significant breakthrough was made in studies of this little fly, combining
    molecular biological methods with classical and molecular genetics. The
    answers to questions about early pattern formation raised new questions
    about the architecture of ovaries and the growth of eggs within these
    ovaries. However, by concentrating only on Drosophila it is not possible to
    form an adequate picture of what is going on in insect ovaries, since the
    enormous diversity found among insects is not considered sufficiently.
    Almost forgotten, but the first to study the architecture of ovaries, was
    Alexander Brandt writing in 1878 in aber das Ei und seine Bildungsstaette
    (On the egg and its organ of development). More than 100 years later, a
    series of ten books or more would be required to survey all the serious
    informa­ tion we have today on insect oogenesis. Thus, this book is a
    personal selection and personal view on the theme, and the authors must be
    excused by all those scientists whose papers could not be included. The book
    briefly describes the ectodemes, i. e.

  abstract: >-
    Among organophosphorothioate (OPT) pesticides, malathion is considered
    relatively safe for use in mammals. Its rapid degradation by
    carboxylesterases competes with the cytochrome P450 ( P450)-catalyzed
    formation of malaoxon, the toxic metabolite. However, impurities in
    commercial formulations are potent inhibitors of carboxylesterase, allowing
    a dramatic increase in malaoxon formation. Malathion desulfuration has been
    characterized in human liver microsomes (HLMs) with a method based on
    acetylcholinesterase inhibition that is able to detect nanomolar levels of
    oxon. The active P450 isoforms have been identified by means of a
    multifaceted strategy, including the use of cDNA-expressed human P450s and
    correlation, immunoinhibition, and chemical inhibition studies in a panel of
    phenotyped HLMs. HLMs catalyzed malaoxon formation with a high level of
    variability (> 200-fold). One or two components (K-mapp1 = 53 - 67 muM;
    K-mapp2 = 427- 1721 muM) were evidenced, depending on the relative specific
    P450 content. Results from different approaches indicated that, at low
    malathion concentration, malaoxon formation is catalyzed by CYP1A2 and, to a
    lesser extent, 2B6, whereas the role of 3A4 is relevant only at high
    malathion levels. These results are in line with those found with
    chlorpyrifos, diazinon, azynphos-methyl, and parathion, characterized by the
    presence of an aromatic ring in the molecule. Since malathion has linear
    chains as substituents at the thioether sulfur, it can be hypothesized that,
    independently from the chemical structure, OPTs are bioactivated by the same
    P450s. These results also suggest that CYP1A2 and 2B6 can be considered as
    possible metabolic biomarkers of susceptibility to OPT-induced toxic effects
    at actual human exposure levels.

    Microplitis demolitor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a parasitoid used as a
    biological control agent to control larval-stage Lepidoptera and serves as a
    model for studying the function and evolution of symbiotic viruses in the
    genus Bracovirus. Here we present the M. demolitor genome (assembly version
    2.0), with a genome size of 241 Mb, and a N50 scaffold and contig size of
    1.1 Mb and 14 Kb, respectively. Using RNA-Seq data and manual annotation of
    genes of viral origin, we produced a high-quality gene set that includes
    18,586 eukaryotic and 171 virus-derived protein-coding genes. Bracoviruses
    are dsDNA viruses with unusual genome architecture, in which the viral
    genome is integrated into the wasp genome and is comprised of two distinct
    components: proviral segments that are amplified, circularized, and packaged
    into virions for export into the wasp’s host via oviposition; and
    replication genes. This genome assembly revealed that at least two scaffolds
    contain both nudivirus-like genes and proviral segments, demonstrating that
    at least some of these components are near each other in the genome on a
    single chromosome. The updated assembly and annotation are available in
    several publicly accessible databases; including the National Center for
    Biotechnology Information and the Ag Data Commons. In addition, all raw
    sequence data available for M. demolitor have been consolidated and are
    available for visualization at the i5k Workspace. This whole genome assembly
    and annotation represents the only genome-scale, annotated assembly from the
    lineage of parasitoid wasps that has associations with bracoviruses (the
    ‘microgastroid complex’), providing important baseline knowledge about the
    architecture of co-opted virus symbiont genomes.

    Overexpression of sirtuins(NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been
    reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae),
    Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster(1-3). Studies of the
    effects of genes on ageing are vulnerable to confounding effects of genetic
    background(4). Here were-examined the reported effects of sirtuin
    overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic
    background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent
    effects in both C. elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, outcrossing of a
    line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression(1) abrogated the longevity
    increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. Instead, longevity
    co-segregated with a second-site mutation affecting sensory neurons.
    Outcrossing of a line with low-copy-number sir-2.1 overexpression(2) also
    abrogated longevity. A Drosophila strain with ubiquitous overexpression of
    dSir2 using the UAS-GAL4 system was long-lived relative to wild-type
    controls, as previously reported(3), but was not long-lived relative to the
    appropriate transgenic controls, and nor was a new line with stronger
    overexpression of dSir2. These findings underscore the importance of
    controlling for genetic background and for the mutagenic effects of
    transgene insertions in studies of genetic effects on lifespan. The
    life-extending effect of dietary restriction on ageing in Drosophila has
    also been reported to be dSir2 dependent(3). We found that dietary
    restriction increased fly lifespan independently of dSir2. Our findings do
    not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but
    they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of
    sirtuins on lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila.

    Genomes assembled de novo from short reads are highly fragmented relative to
    the finished chromosomes of Homo sapiens and key model organisms generated
    by the Human Genome Project. To address this problem, we need scalable,
    cost-effective methods to obtain assemblies with chromosome-scale
    contiguity. Here we show that genome-wide chromatin interaction data sets,
    such as those generated by Hi-C, are a rich source of long-range information
    for assigning, ordering and orienting genomic sequences to chromosomes,
    including across centromeres. To exploit this finding, we developed an
    algorithm that uses Hi-C data for ultra-long-range scaffolding of de novo
    genome assemblies. We demonstrate the approach by combining shotgun fragment
    and short jump mate-pair sequences with Hi-C data to generate

  abstract: >-
    The steroid hormone ecdysone regulates larval development and metamorphosis
    in Drosophila melanogaster through a complex genetic hierarchy that begins
    with a small set of early response genes. Here, we present data indicating
    that the ecdysone response hierarchy also mediates egg chamber maturation
    during mid-oogenesis. E75, E74 and BR-C are expressed in a stage-specific
    manner while EcR expression is ubiquitous throughout oogenesis. Decreasing
    or increasing the ovarian ecdysone titer using a temperature-sensitive
    mutation or exogenous ecdysone results in corresponding changes in early
    gene expression. The stage 10 follicle cell expression of E75 in wild-type,
    K10 and EGF receptor (Egfr) mutant egg chambers reveals regulation of E75 by
    both the Egfr and ecdysone signaling pathways. Genetic analysis indicates a
    germline requirement for ecdysone-responsive gene expression, Germline
    clones of E75 mutations arrest and degenerate during mid-oogenesis and EcR
    germline clones exhibit a similar phenotype, demonstrating a functional
    requirement for ecdysone responsiveness during the vitellogenic phase of
    oogenesis. Finally, the expression of Drosophila Adrenodoxin Reductase
    increases during mid-oogenesis and clonal analysis confirms that this
    steroidogenic enzyme is required in the germline for egg chamber
    development, Together these data suggest that the temporal expression
    profile of E75, E74 and BR-C may be a functional reflection of ecdysone
    levels and that ecdysone provides temporal signals regulating the
    progression of oogenesis and proper specification of dorsal follicle cell
    fates.

    1. Ovary development in worker honeybees is inhibited by 9-oxodecenoic acid
    or its vapour.2. A scent from the queen, in addition to her 9-oxodecenoic
    acid, also inhibits oogenesis in workers, but it is less effective than the
    acid. The scent and acid do not work together synergically.3. Neither
    9-oxodecenoic acid nor queen scent, nor the two together, are as effective
    in inhibiting oogenesis in workers as access to a live queen. Older, mated
    queens are more effective than younger, virgin ones.4. Injection of
    9-oxodecenoic acid partially inhibits ovary development in workers, but does
    not inhibit queen rearing by them.The mode of action of this acid is still
    uncertain.

  abstract: >-
    Understanding gene regulation and function requires a genome-wide method
    capable of capturing both gene expression levels and isoform diversity at
    the single-cell level. Short-read RNAseq is limited in its ability to
    resolve complex isoforms because it fails to sequence full-length cDNA
    copies of RNA molecules. Here, we investigate whether RNAseq using the
    long-read single-molecule Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer is able to
    identify and quantify complex isoforms without sacrificing accurate gene
    expression quantification. After benchmarking our approach, we analyse
    individual murine B1a cells using a custom multiplexing strategy. We
    identify thousands of unannotated transcription start and end sites, as well
    as hundreds of alternative splicing events in these B1a cells. We also
    identify hundreds of genes expressed across B1a cells that display multiple
    complex isoforms, including several B cell-specific surface receptors. Our
    results show that we can identify and quantify complex isoforms at the
    single cell level.

    The diversity and scope of multiplex parallel sequencing applications is
    steadily increasing. Critically, multiplex parallel sequencing applications
    methods rely on the use of barcoded primers for sample identification, and
    the quality of the barcodes directly impacts the quality of the resulting
    sequence data. Inspection of the recent publications reveals a surprisingly
    variable quality of the barcodes employed. Some barcodes are made in a semi
    empirical fashion, without quantitative consideration of error correction or
    minimal distance properties. After systematic comparison of published
    barcode sets, including commercially distributed barcoded primers from
    Illumina and Epicentre, methods for improved, Hamming code-based sequences
    are suggested and illustrated. Hamming barcodes can be employed for DNA tag
    designs in many different ways while preserving minimal distance and
    error-correcting properties. In addition, Hamming barcodes remain flexible
    with regard to essential biological parameters such as sequence redundancy
    and GC content. Wider adoption of improved Hamming barcodes is encouraged in
    multiplex parallel sequencing applications.

  abstract: >-
    The factors regulating the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a ubiquitous
    family of similar to22-nt noncoding regulatory RNAs, remain undefined.
    However, it is known that miRNAs are first transcribed as a largely
    unstructured precursor, termed a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), which is
    sequentially processed in the nucleus, to give the similar to65-nt pre-miRNA
    hairpin intermediate, and then in the cytoplasm, to give the mature miRNA.
    Here we have sought to identify the RNA polymerase responsible for miRNA
    transcription and to define the structure of a full-length human miRNA. We
    show that the pri-miRNA precursors for nine human miRNAs are both capped and
    polyadenylated and report the sequence of the full-length, similar to3433-nt
    pri-miR-21 RNA. This pri-miR-21 gene sequence is flanked 5' by a promoter
    element able to transcribe heterologous mRNAs and 3' by a consensus
    polyadenylation sequence. Nuclear processing of pri-miRNAs was found to be
    efficient, thus largely preventing the nuclear export of full-length
    pri-miRNAs. Nevertheless, an intact miRNA stem-loop precursor located in the
    3' UTR of a protein coding gene only moderately inhibited expression of the
    linked open reading frame, probably because the 3' truncated mRNA could
    still be exported and expressed. Together, these data show that human
    pri-miRNAs are not only structurally similar to mRNAs but can, in fact,
    function both as pri-miRNAs and mRNAs.

  abstract: >-
    Network biology aims to understand cell behavior through the analysis of
    underlying complex biomolecular networks. Inference of condition-specific
    interaction networks from epigenomic data enables the characterization of
    the structural plasticity that regulatory networks can acquire in different
    tissues of the same organism. From this perspective, uncovering specific
    patterns of variation by comparing network structure among tissues could
    provide insights into systems-level mechanisms underlying cell behavior.
    Following this idea, here we propose an empirical framework to analyze
    mammalian tissue-specific networks, focusing on characterizing and
    contrasting their structure and behavior in response to perturbations. We
    structurally represent the state of the cell/tissue by condition specific
    transcription factor networks generated using DNase-seq chromatin
    accessibility data, and we profile their systems behavior in terms of the
    structural robustness against random and directed perturbations. Using this
    framework, we unveil the structural heterogeneity existing among tissues at
    different levels of differentiation. We uncover a novel and conserved
    systems property of regulatory networks underlying embryonic stem cells
    (ESCs): in contrast to terminally differentiated tissues, the promiscuous
    regulatory connectivity of ESCs produces a globally homogeneous network
    resulting in increased structural robustness. We show that this property is
    associated with a more permissive, less restrictive chromatin accesibility
    state in ESCs. Possible biological consequences of this property are
    discussed.

  abstract: >-
    The anterior nares are an important reservoir for opportunistic pathogens
    and commensal microorganisms. A barcoded Illumina paired-end sequencing
    method targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA V1-2 hypervariable region was
    developed to compare the bacterial diversity of the anterior nares across
    distinct human populations (volunteers from Germany vs a Babongo Pygmy
    tribe, Africa). Of the 251 phylotypes detected, 231 could be classified to
    the genus level and 109 to the species level, including the unambiguous
    identification of the ubiquitous Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella
    catarrhalis. The global bacterial community of both adult populations
    revealed that they shared 85% of the phylotypes, suggesting that our global
    bacterial communities have likely been with us for thousands of years. Of
    the 34 phylotypes unique to the non-westernized population, most were
    related to members within the suborder Micrococcineae. There was an even
    more overwelming distinction between children and adults of the same
    population, suggesting a progression of a childhood community of
    high-diversity comprising species of Moraxellaceae and Streptococcaceae to
    an adult community of lower diversity comprising species of
    Propionibacteriaceae, Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI, Corynebacteriaceae
    and Staphylococcaceae. Thus, age was a stronger factor for accounting for
    differing bacterial assemblages than the origin of the human population
    sampled.

    Here we show how the 10 genes of the alpha esterase cluster of Drosophila
    melanogaster have diverged substantially in their expression profiles.
    Together with previously described sequence divergence this suggests
    substantial functional diversification. By peptide mass fingerprinting and
    in vitro gene expression we have also shown that two of the genes encode the
    isozymes EST9 (formerly ESTC) and EST23. EST9 is the major 'alpha staining'
    esterase in zymograms of gut tissues in feeding stages while orthologues of
    EST23 confer resistance to organophosphorus insecticides in other higher
    Diptera. The results for EST9 and EST23 concur with previous suggestions
    that the products of the alpha esterase cluster function in digestion and
    detoxification of xenobiotic esters. However, many of the other genes in the
    cluster show developmental or tissue-specific expression that seems
    inconsistent with such roles. Furthermore, there is generally poor
    correspondence between the mRNA expression patterns of the remaining eight
    genes and isozymes previously characterized by standard techniques of
    electrophoresis and staining, suggesting that the alpha cluster might only
    account for a small minority of the esterase isozyme profile.

    Messenger RNA levels of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP6A1 were measured in the
    insecticide resistant Diazinon-R 'Rutgers' strain and in the susceptible
    strain sbo of the house fly with a cloned cDNA probe. The constitutive
    expression of the CYP6A1 gene was at least 10 times higher in the Rutgers
    strain than in the sbo strain. In both strains, CYP6A1 was inducible by
    phenobarbital treatment of the flies. Analysis of genomic DNA from the two
    strains indicated that there was no amplification of the CYP6A1 gene in the
    Rutgers strain. A developmental analysis revealed that CYP6A1 is expressed
    larvae and adults, and very low levels of CYP6A1 mRNA were detected in eggs
    and pupae. The constitutive overexpression of CYP6A1 in the Rutgers strain
    was observed in both larvae and adults. Crosses between the Rutgers strain
    and the multiply marked sbo strain revealed that the high constitutive
    expression of CYP6A1 in the Rutgers strain is controlled by one or more loci
    located on chromosome II.

    The Jonah gene family consists of approximately 20 genes, distributed in
    small clusters at eight or more widely dispersed chromosomal sites. Gene
    clusters differ in the number of genes per cluster, ranging up to four, and
    in the arrangement of genes within clusters, which include direct repeats,
    inverted repeats, and combinations of direct and inverted repeats. In the
    third-instar larva the Jonah genes are abundantly expressed as transcripts
    of a single size class, located exclusively in the midgut. The Jonah genes
    were initially defined by homology to a reference cDNA clone. However, the
    structural heterogeneity within this gene family is so large that Jonah
    genes that fail to hybridize to the reference cDNA, yet hybridize to other
    members of the family that do hybridize to that cDNA have been subsequently
    identified. These findings raise questions regarding the sharpness of gene
    family boundaries.

  abstract: >-
    The success of biological control may depend on the control agent
    co-evolving with its target pest species, precluding the emergence of
    resistance that often undermines chemical control. However, recent evidence
    of a decline in attack rates of a sexual pest weevil by its asexual
    parasitoid suggests that evolutionary arms races may not prevent the
    emergence of resistance if the host and parasitoid do not have reproductive
    strategies that generate equal amounts of genetic variation. To understand
    how these asymmetries in reproductive strategies may drive the emergence of
    resistance, we combined life history data from two pest weevils and their
    parasitoids (one sexual and one asexual) in the New Zealand pastoral
    ecosystem, with a population dynamic model that allows the coevolution of
    hosts and parasitoids. We found that the ratio of the genetic variance of
    hosts to parasitoids was a key determinant of the emergence of resistance.
    Host resistance eventually occurred unless the parasitoids had considerably
    greater additive genetic variance than their host. The higher reproductive
    rate of asexual parasitoids did little to offset the cost of reduced
    additive genetic variance. The model predictions were congruent with
    long-term parasitism rates observed in the field for both of the pests
    considered (one with a sexual and one with an asexual parasitoid). We then
    explored the consequences of introducing two parasitoids with different
    reproductive strategies that attack the same sexual host. The model showed
    that the sexually reproducing parasitoid always out-competed the asexually
    reproducing one. Our study shows that any asymmetry in reproductive
    strategies is extremely important for predicting the long-term success of
    biological control agents. Fortunately, introduction of sexually reproducing
    individuals after an initial introduction of asexual strains may overcome
    the problems of host resistance. We conclude that evolution must be
    considered when evaluating the long-term outcomes of importation biological
    control.

  abstract: "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an early-stage breast cancer that infrequently progresses to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Genomic evolution has been difficult to delineate during invasion due to intratumor heterogeneity and the low number of tumor cells in the ducts. To overcome these challenges, we\_developed Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) to measure genomic copy number profiles of single tumor cells while preserving their spatial context in tissue sections. We applied TSCS to 1,293 single cells from 10 synchronous patients with both DCIS and IDC regions in addition to exome sequencing. Our data reveal a direct genomic lineage between in situ and invasive tumor subpopulations and further show that most mutations and copy number aberrations evolved within the ducts prior to invasion. These results support a multiclonal invasion model, in which one or more clones escape the ducts and migrate into the adjacent tissues to establish the invasive carcinomas."

  abstract: >-
    Neonicotinoids are one of the three principal insecticide chemotypes. The
    seven major commercial neonicotinoids are readily biodegraded by metabolic
    attack at their N-heterocyclylmethyl moiety, heterocyclic or acyclic spacer,
    and N-nitroimine, nitromethylene, or N-cyanoimine tip. Phase I metabolism is
    largely dependent on microsomal CYP450 isozymes with situ selectivity in
    hydroxylation, desaturation, dealkylation, sulfoxidation, and nitro
    reduction. Cytosolic aldehyde oxidase is a nitroreductase for some
    neonicotinoids. Phase II metabolism involves methylation, acetylation, and
    formation of glucuronide, glucoside, amino acid, and sulfate- and
    glutathione-derived conjugates. Some neonicotinoids act as proinsecticides
    with metabolism to more potent nicotinic agonists. Pest resistance is more
    commonly due to synergist-reversible CYP450 detoxification than to nAChR
    mutants or variants. Metabolites in some cases contribute to mammalian
    hepatotoxicity and carcinogenesis and in others to enhanced plant vigor and
    stress shields. These relationships explain much of neonicotinoid
    comparative toxicology and provide the basis for continued and improved
    safety and effectiveness of this chemotype.

    Previous work showed that insecticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster
    is correlated with the insertion of an Accord-like element into the 5'
    region of the cytochrome P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Here, we study the distribution
    of the Accord-like element in 673 recently collected D. melanogaster lines
    from 34 world-wide populations. We also examine the extent of microsatellite
    variability along a 180-kilobase (kb) genomic region of chromosome II
    encompassing the resistance gene. We confirm a 100% correlation of the
    Accord insertion with insecticide resistance and a significant reduction in
    variability extending at least 20 kb downstream of the Cyp6g1 gene. The
    frequency of the Accord insertion differs significantly between East African
    (32-55%) and nonAfrican (85-100%) populations. This pattern is consistent
    with a selective sweep driving the Accord insertion close to fixation in
    nonAfrican populations as a result of the insecticide resistance phenotype
    it confers. This study confirms that hitchhiking mapping can be used to
    identify beneficial mutations in natural populations.

    Massively parallel short-read sequencing technologies, coupled with powerful
    software platforms, are enabling investigators to analyse tens of thousands
    of genetic markers. This wealth of data is rapidly expanding and allowing
    biological questions to be addressed with unprecedented scope and precision.
    The sizes of the data sets are now posing significant data processing and
    analysis challenges. Here we describe an extension of the Stacks software
    package to efficiently use genotype-by-sequencing data for studies of
    populations of organisms. Stacks now produces core population genomic
    summary statistics and SNP-by-SNP statistical tests. These statistics can be
    analysed across a reference genome using a smoothed sliding window. Stacks
    also now provides several output formats for several commonly used
    downstream analysis packages. The expanded population genomics functions in
    Stacks will make it a useful tool to harness the newest generation of
    massively parallel genotyping data for ecological and evolutionary genetics.

  abstract: >-
    Besides ethanol, acetic acid is produced in naturally fermenting sweet
    resources and is a significant environmental stress for fruit-breeding
    Drosophila populations and species. Although not related to the presence of
    an active alcohol dehydrogenase, adult acetic acid tolerance was found to
    correlate with ethanol tolerance when sensitive (Afrotropical) and resistant
    (European) natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster were compared. The
    same correlation was found when comparing various Drosophila species.
    Tolerance to acetic acid also correlated with the tolerance to longer
    aliphatic acids of three, four, or five carbons but did not correlate with
    the tolerance to inorganic acids (i.e., hydrochloric and sulfuric acids).
    These observations suggest that acetic acid is detoxified by the conversion
    of acetate into acetyl-CoA, a metabolic step also involved in ethanol
    detoxification. Future investigations on the adaptation of Drosophila to
    fermenting resources should consider selective effects of both ethanol and
    acetic acid.

    Engineered gene drives — the process of stimulating the biased inheritance
    of specific genes — have the potential to enable the spread of desirable
    genes throughout wild populations or to suppress harmful species, and may be
    particularly useful for the control of vector-borne diseases such as
    malaria. Although several types of selfish genetic elements exist in nature,
    few have been successfully engineered in the laboratory thus far. With the
    discovery of RNA-guided CRISPR–Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short
    palindromic repeats–CRISPR-associated 9) nucleases, which can be utilized to
    create, streamline and improve synthetic gene drives, this is rapidly
    changing. Here, we discuss the different types of engineered gene drives and
    their potential applications, as well as current policies regarding the
    safety and regulation of gene drives for the manipulation of wild
    populations.

  abstract: >-
    The homeobox is a 180 bp consensus DNA sequence present in a number of genes
    involved in developmental processes. This review focuses on the structure
    and function of plant homeobox genes and of the proteins they encode. Plant
    homeobox genes have been identified in studies using mutants, degenerate
    oligonucleotides deduced from conserved sequences, differential screening or
    binding to known promoters. According to sequence conservation, plant
    homeoboxes can be subdivided into different families, each comprising
    several members. Evolutionary studies indicate that the different families
    have diverged prior to the separation of the branches leading to animals,
    plants and fungi. Accordingly, members of different families show
    characteristic structural and functional properties. As an example, kn1-like
    genes seem to be involved in different aspects of the control of cell fate
    determination in the shoot meristem; HD-Zip genes, which encode proteins
    containing a leucine zipper motif adjacent to the homeodomain, are believed
    to operate at later stages of development; and gl2-like genes are involved
    in epidermal cell differentiation. Future studies should be oriented to
    discern the precise function of the many homeobox genes present in plant
    genomes, and to evaluate their use as modifiers of plant development.

    We present Meraculous2, an update to the Meraculous short-read assembler
    that includes (1) handling of allelic variation using "bubble" structures
    within the de Bruijn graph, (2) improved gap closing, and (3) an improved
    scaffolding algorithm that produces more complete assemblies without
    compromising scaffolding accuracy. The speed and bandwidth efficiency of the
    new parallel implementation have also been substantially improved, allowing
    the assembly of a human genome to be accomplished in 24 hours on the
    JGI/NERSC Genepool system. To highlight the features of Meraculous2 we
    present here the assembly of the diploid human genome NA12878, and compare
    it with previously published assemblies of the same data using other
    algorithms. The Meraculous2 assemblies are shown to have better
    completeness, contiguity, and accuracy than other published assemblies for
    these data. Practical considerations including pre-assembly analyses of
    polymorphism and repetitiveness are described.

  abstract: >-
    We describe a new algorithm, meraculous, for whole genome assembly of deep
    paired-end short reads, and apply it to the assembly of a dataset of paired
    75-bp Illumina reads derived from the 15.4 megabase genome of the haploid
    yeast Pichia stipitis. More than 95% of the genome is recovered, with no
    errors; half the assembled sequence is in contigs longer than 101 kilobases
    and in scaffolds longer than 269 kilobases. Incorporating fosmid ends
    recovers entire chromosomes. Meraculous relies on an efficient and
    conservative traversal of the subgraph of the k-mer (deBruijn) graph of
    oligonucleotides with unique high quality extensions in the dataset,
    avoiding an explicit error correction step as used in other short-read
    assemblers. A novel memory-efficient hashing scheme is introduced. The
    resulting contigs are ordered and oriented using paired reads separated by
    ∼280 bp or ∼3.2 kbp, and many gaps between contigs can be closed using
    paired-end placements. Practical issues with the dataset are described, and
    prospects for assembling larger genomes are discussed.

    Cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases are a large group of
    heme-containing enzymes, most of which catalyze NADPH- and O-2-dependent
    hydroxylation reactions. The cloning of plant P450s has been hampered
    because these membrane-localized proteins are typically present in low
    abundance and are often unstable to purification. Since the cloning of the
    first plant P450 gene in 1990, there has been an explosion in the rate at
    which genes encoding plant P450s have been identified. These successes have
    largely been the result of advances in purification techniques, as well as
    the application of alternative methods such as mutant- and PCR-based cloning
    strategies. The availability of these cloned genes has made possible the
    analysis of P450 gene regulation and may soon reveal aspects of the
    evolution of P450s in plants. This new knowledge will significantly improve
    our understanding of many metabolic pathways and may permit their
    manipulation in the near future.

    This paper describes the construction and characterization of a system of
    transcriptional reporter genes for monitoring the activity of signaling
    pathways and gene regulation mechanisms in intact Drosophila, dissected
    tissues or cultured cells. Transgenic integration of the reporters into the
    Drosophila germline was performed in a site-directed manner, using ΦC31
    integrase. This strategy avoids variable position effects and assures low
    base level activity and high signal responsiveness. Defined integration
    sites furthermore enable the experimenter to compare the activity of
    different reporters in one organism. The reporter constructs have a modular
    design to facilitate the combination of promoter elements (synthetic
    transcription factor binding sites or natural regulatory sequences),
    reporter genes (eGFP, or DsRed.T4), and genomic integration sites. The
    system was used to analyze and compare the activity and signal response
    profiles of two stress inducible transcription factors, AP-1 and Nrf2. To
    complement the transgenic reporter fly lines, tissue culture assays were
    developed in which the same synthetic ARE and TRE elements control the
    expression of firefly luciferase.

    Ecdysteroids regulate a wide variety of cellular processes during arthropod
    development, yet little is known about the genes involved in the
    biosynthesis of these hormones. Previous studies have suggested that
    production of 20-hydroxyecdysone in Drosophila and other arthropods involves
    a series of cytochrome P450 catalyzed hydroxylations of cholesterol. In this
    report, we show that the disembodied (dib) locus of Drosophila codes for a
    P450-like sequence. In addition, we find that dib mutant embryos have very
    low titers of ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and fail to express
    IMP-E1 and L1, two 20E-inducible genes, in certain tissues of the embryo. In
    situ hybridization studies reveal that dib is expressed in a complex pattern
    in the early embryo, which eventually gives way to restricted expression in
    the prothoracic portion of the ring gland. In larval and adult tissues, dib
    expression is observed in the prothoracic gland and follicle cells of the
    ovaries respectively, two tissues known to synthesize ecdysteroids.
    Phenotypic analysis reveals that dib mutant embryos produce little or no
    cuticle and exhibit severe defects in many late morphogenetic processes such
    as head involution, dorsal closure and gut development. In addition, we
    examined the phenotypes of several other mutants that produce defective
    embryonic cuticles. Like dib, mutations in the spook (spo) locus result in
    low embryonic ecdysteroid titers, severe late embryonic morphological
    defects, and a failure to induce IMP-E1. From these data, we conclude that
    dib and spo likely code for essential components in the ecdysone
    biosynthetic pathway and that ecdysteroids regulate many late embryonic
    morphogenetic processes such as cell movement and cuticle deposition.

  abstract: "Cytochrome P450 CYP6G1 has been implicated in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster to numerous pesticides. While in\_vivo and in\_vitro studies have provided insight to the diverse functions of this enzyme, direct studies on the isolated CYP6G1 enzyme have not been possible due to the need for a source of recombinant enzyme. In the current study, the Cyp6g1 gene was isolated from D.\_melanogaster and re-engineered for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Approximately 460\_nmol\_L−1 of P450 holoenzyme were obtained in 500\_mL cultures. The recombinant enzyme was located predominantly within the bacterial cytosol. A two-step purification protocol using Ni-chelate affinity chromatography followed by removal of detergent on a hydroxyapatite column produced essentially homogenous enzyme from both soluble and membrane fractions. Recombinant CYP6G1 exhibited p-nitroanisole O-dealkylation activity but was not active against eleven other typical P450 marker substrates. Substrate-induced binding spectra and IC50 values for inhibition of p-nitroanisole O-dealkylation were obtained for a wide selection of pesticides, namely DDT, imidacloprid, chlorfenvinphos, malathion, endosulfan, dieldrin, dicyclanil, lufenuron and carbaryl, supporting previous in\_vivo and in\_vitro studies on Drosophila that have suggested that the enzyme is involved in multi-pesticide resistance in insects."

  abstract: >-
    Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), encoded by the Ace gene, is the primary target
    of organophosphorous (OP) and carbamate insecticides. Ace mutations have
    been identified in OP resistants strains of Drosophila melanogaster.
    However, in the Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, resistance in
    field and laboratory generated strains is determined by point mutations in
    the Rop-1 gene, which encodes a carboxylesterase, E3. To investigate the
    apparent bias for the Rop-1/E3 mechanism in the evolution of OP resistance
    in L. cuprina, we have cloned the Ace gene from this species and
    characterized its product. Southern hybridization indicates the existence of
    a single Ace gene in L. cuprina. The amino acid sequence of L. cuprina AChE
    shares 85.3% identity with D. melanogaster and 92.4% with Musca domestica
    AChE. Five point mutations in Ace associated with reduced sensitivity to OP
    insecticides have been previously detected in resistant strains of D.
    melanogaster. These residues are identical in susceptible strains of D.
    melanogaster and L. cuprina, although different codons are used. Each of the
    amino acid substitutions that confer OP resistance in D. melanogaster could
    also occur in L. cuprina by a single non-synonymous substitution. These data
    suggest that the resistance mechanism used in L. cuprina is determined by
    factors other than codon bias. The same point mutations, singly and in
    combination, were introduced into the Ace gene of L. cuprina by
    site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting AChE enzymes expressed using a
    baculovirus system to characterise their kinetic properties and interactions
    with OP insecticides. The K(m) of wild type AChE for acetylthiocholine
    (ASCh) is 23.13 microM and the point mutations change the affinity to the
    substrate. The turnover number of Lucilia AChE for ASCh was estimated to be
    1.27x10(3) min(-1), similar to Drosophila or housefly AChE. The single amino
    acid replacements reduce the affinities of the AChE for OPs and give up to
    8.7-fold OP insensitivity, while combined mutations give up to 35-fold
    insensitivity. However, other published studies indicate these same
    mutations yield higher levels of OP insensitivity in D. melanogaster and A.
    aegypti. The inhibition data indicate that the wild type form of AChE of L.
    cuprina is 12.4-fold less sensitive to OP inhibition than the susceptible
    form of E3, suggesting that the carboxylesterases may have a role in the
    protection of AChE via a sequestration mechanism. This provides a possible
    explanation for the bias towards the evolution of resistance via the
    Rop-1/E3 mechanism in L. cuprina.

    CYP6B1v1 is the principal cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) that
    detoxifies dietary furanocoumarins in the guts of Papilio polyxenes , the
    black swallowtail caterpillar. Sequence alignments and structure comparisons
    of CYP6B1v1 with the mouse CYP2A5 and bacterial CYP102 proteins, which are
    also capable of metabolizing the linear furanocoumarin xanthotoxin
    (8-methoxypsoralen), suggested that Phe116, His117, Val368 and Phe484 might
    be active site residues. In a homology model developed for CYP6B1v1, the
    side chains of Phe116 and His117 located in the B'-C loop of SRS1 are
    predicted to be positioned above the haem plane, while the side chain of
    Phe484 located in SRS6 is predicted near the entrance of the catalytic
    pocket. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues Phe116, His117 and Phe484
    indicated that these residues represent several of those that determine this
    protein's stability and substrate specificity. Whereas all aromatic mutants
    of Phe116 and Phe484 generated CO-difference spectra with maxima at 450 nm
    indicative of correctly configured monooxygenases, aromatic mutants of
    Phe116 exhibited reduced reactivities toward some furanocoumarins and
    aromatic mutants of Phe484 eliminated all reactivities toward
    furanocoumarins. All single and double aliphatic mutants of Phe116, His117
    and Phe484 and aromatic mutants of His117 generated carbon monoxide (CO)
    difference spectra with maxima at 420 nm (P420) indicative of incorrectly
    configured monooxygenases. These studies define residues Phe116, His117 and
    Phe484 as determinants of this insect P450's catalytic site integrity and
    residues Phe116 and Phe484 as determinants of its substrate specificity.
    Conservation of Phe116 and His117 in an array of lepidopteran CYP6B proteins
    implies that these amino acids serve a similar function in other
    monooxygenases of the insect CYP6B subfamily.

  abstract: >-
    Antarctic notothenioid fishes and several northern cods are phylogenetically
    distant (in different orders and superorders), yet produce near-identical
    antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) to survive in their respective freezing
    environments. AFGPs in both fishes are made as a family of discretely sized
    polymers composed of a simple glycotripeptide monomeric repeat.
    Characterizations of the AFGP genes from notothenioids and the Arctic cod
    show that their AFGPs are both encoded by a family of polyprotein genes,
    with each gene encoding multiple AFGP molecules linked in tandem by small
    cleavable spacers. Despite these apparent similarities, detailed analyses of
    the AFGP gene sequences and substructures provide strong evidence that AFGPs
    in these two polar fishes in fact evolved independently. First, although
    Antarctic notothenioid AFGP genes have been shown to originate from a
    pancreatic trypsinogen, Arctic cod AFGP genes share no sequence identity
    with the trypsinogen gene, indicating trypsinogen is not the progenitor.
    Second, the AFGP genes of the two fish have different intron-exon
    organizations and different spacer sequences and, thus, different processing
    of the polyprotein precursors, consistent with separate genomic origins.
    Third, the repetitive AFGP tripeptide (Thr-Ala/Pro-Ala) coding sequences are
    drastically different in the two groups of genes, suggesting that they arose
    from duplications of two distinct, short ancestral sequences with a
    different permutation of three codons for the same tripeptide. The molecular
    evidence for separate ancestry is supported by morphological,
    paleontological, and paleoclimatic evidence, which collectively indicate
    that these two polar fishes evolved their respective AFGPs separately and
    thus arrived at the same AFGPs through convergent evolution.

    Single-cell measurement techniques can now probe gene expression in
    heterogeneous cell populations from the human body across a range of
    environmental and physiological conditions. However, new mathematical and
    computational methods are required to represent and analyze gene expression
    changes that occur in complex mixtures of single cells as they respond to
    signals, drugs, or disease states. Here, we introduce a mathematical
    modeling platform, PopAlign, that automatically identifies subpopulations of
    cells within a heterogeneous mixture, and tracks gene expression and cell
    abundance changes across subpopulations by constructing and comparing
    probabilistic models. We apply PopAlign to discover specific categories of
    signaling responses within primary human immune cells as well as
    patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma that are obscured by
    techniques like tSNE. We anticipate that PopAlign will enable large scale
    studies of natural and engineered cell populations as they respond to drugs,
    signals or physiological change.

    The WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) genes are important transcription
    regulators participated in plant development processes. Rice (Oryza sativa
    L.) genome encodes at least 13 WOX members. In this study, a systematic
    microarray-based gene expression profiling of eleven WOX genes was performed
    for the whole life cycle of rice at 16 different tissues/organs of MH63
    (rice indica cultivar), which included eight reproductive organs and eight
    vegetative tissues. The results demonstrated that four genes (OsWUS,
    OsNS1/OsNS2, OsWOX3 and OsWOX9A) were specifically expressed in panicle and
    endosperm development, and six genes (OsWOX5, OsWOX9B, OsWOX9D, OsWOX11,
    OsWOX12A and OsWOX12B) were preferentially expressed in seeds (72h after
    imbibitions) during root emergence or growth. In situ hybridization analysis
    revealed differential transcript levels of OsWOX4, OsWOX5, OsWOX9A and
    OsWOX12B during panicle development and embryogenesis. Results of qRT-PCR
    showed that expression of four rice WOX genes (OsWOX5, OsWOX11, OsWOX12B and
    OsWOX12A) was up- or down-regulated by plant hormones (auxin, cytokinin and
    gibberellin). More interestingly, most WOX genes were responsive to abiotic
    stress stimuli of drought, salt and cold. The molecular studies presented
    here will further provide insight in understanding the functions of rice WOX
    gene family in rice development, hormone signaling, and abiotic stress
    response.

    While genome assembly projects have been successful in many haploid and
    inbred species, the assembly of noninbred or rearranged heterozygous genomes
    remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce the
    open-source FALCON and FALCON-Unzip algorithms
    (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/FALCON/) to assemble long-read
    sequencing data into highly accurate, contiguous, and correctly phased
    diploid genomes. We generate new reference sequences for heterozygous
    samples including an F1 hybrid of Arabidopsis thaliana, the widely
    cultivated Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, and the coral fungus
    Clavicorona pyxidata, samples that have challenged short-read assembly
    approaches. The FALCON-based assemblies are substantially more contiguous
    and complete than alternate short- or long-read approaches. The phased
    diploid assembly enabled the study of haplotype structure and
    heterozygosities between homologous chromosomes, including the
    identification of widespread heterozygous structural variation within coding
    sequences.

    FlyAtlas, a new online resource, provides the most comprehensive view yet of
    expression in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. Meta-analysis of
    the data shows that a significant fraction of the genome is expressed with
    great tissue specificity in the adult, demonstrating the need for the
    functional genomic community to embrace a wide range of functional
    phenotypes. Well-known developmental genes are often reused in surprising
    tissues in the adult, suggesting new functions. The homologs of many human
    genetic disease loci show selective expression in the Drosophila tissues
    analogous to the affected human tissues, providing a useful filter for
    potential candidate genes. Additionally, the contributions of each tissue to
    the whole-fly array signal can be calculated, demonstrating the limitations
    of whole-organism approaches to functional genomics and allowing modeling of
    a simple tissue fractionation procedure that should improve detection of
    weak or tissuespecific signals.

  abstract: >-
    One of the challenges faced in malarial control is the acquisition of
    insecticide resistance that has developed in mosquitoes that are vectors for
    this disease. Anopheles gambiae, which has been the major mosquito vector of
    the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in Africa, has over the years
    developed resistance to insecticides including dieldrin,
    1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane (DDT), and pyrethroids.
    Previous microarray studies using fragments of 230An. gambiae genes
    identified five P450 loci, including CYP4C27, CYP4H15, CYP6Z1, CYP6Z2, and
    CYP12F1, that showed significantly higher expression in the DDT-resistant
    ZAN/U strain compared with the DDT-susceptible Kisumu strain. To predict
    whether either of the CYP6Z1 and CYP6Z2 proteins might potentially
    metabolize DDT, we generated and compared molecular models of these two
    proteins with and without DDT docked in their catalytic sites. This
    comparison indicated that, although these two CYP6Z proteins share high
    sequence identity, their metabolic profiles were likely to differ
    dramatically from the larger catalytic site of CYP6Z1, potentially involved
    in DDT metabolism, and the more constrained catalytic site of CYP6Z2, not
    likely to metabolize DDT. Heterologous expressions of these proteins have
    corroborated these predictions: only CYP6Z1 is capable of metabolizing DDT.
    Overlays of these models indicate that slight differences in the backbone of
    SRS1 and variations of side chains in SRS2 and SRS4 account for the
    significant differences in their catalytic site volumes and DDT-metabolic
    capacities. These data identify CYP6Z1 as one important target for inhibitor
    design aimed at inactivating insecticide-metabolizing P450s in natural
    populations of this malarial mosquito.

    RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables characterization and quantification of
    individual transcriptomes as well as detection of patterns of allelic
    expression and alternative splicing. Current RNA-seq protocols depend on
    high-throughput short-read sequencing of cDNA. However, as ongoing advances
    are rapidly yielding increasing read lengths, a technical hurdle remains in
    identifying the degree to which differences in read length influence various
    transcriptome analyses. In this study, we generated two paired-end RNA-seq
    datasets of differing read lengths (2×75 bp and 2×262 bp) for lymphoblastoid
    cell line GM12878 and compared the effect of read length on transcriptome
    analyses, including read-mapping performance, gene and transcript
    quantification, and detection of allele-specific expression (ASE) and
    allele-specific alternative splicing (ASAS) patterns. Our results indicate
    that, while the current long-read protocol is considerably more expensive
    than short-read sequencing, there are important benefits that can only be
    achieved with longer read length, including lower mapping bias and reduced
    ambiguity in assigning reads to genomic elements, such as mRNA transcript.
    We show that these benefits ultimately lead to improved detection of
    cis-acting regulatory and splicing variation effects within individuals.

  abstract: >-
    A combination of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and liquid
    chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry has been used to clarify some new
    aspects of testosterone metabolism. The main pathway of testosterone
    oxidative metabolism by human liver microsomes is the formation of 1β-, 2α-
    /β-, 6β-, 15β-, and 16β-hydroxytestosterones, mainly catalyzed by
    cytochromes P450 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. We now report the first determination
    that 11β-hydroxytestosterone ( 11β-OHT) can also be formed by human liver
    microsomal fractions. The structures of five hydroxylated metabolites of
    testosterone (2β-, 6β-, 11β-, 15β-, and 16β-OHT) and the C-17 oxidative
    metabolite androstenedione were determined by liquid chromatography with UV
    detection at 240 nm and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
    Corresponding results were obtained by high-performance liquid
    chromatography-AMS analysis of incubations of [4-C-14] testosterone with
    human liver microsomes. 6β-Hydroxylation was always the dominant metabolic
    pathway, but 2β-, 15β-, and 16β-OHT, and androstenedione were also formed.
    The previously undetected hydroxytestosterone, 11β-OHT, was found to be a
    minor metabolite formed by human liver microsomal enzymes. It was formed
    more readily by CYP3A4 than by either CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. 11β-Hydroxylation
    was inhibited by ketoconazole (IC50 = 30 nM) at concentrations similar to
    the IC50 (36 nM) for 6β-hydroxylation Therefore, CYP3A4 could be mainly
    responsible for testosterone 11β-hydroxylation in the human liver. These
    findings identify human hepatic biotransformation of testosterone to 11β-OHT
    as a previously unrecognized extra-adrenal metabolic pathway.

  abstract: >-
    Sex-determination mechanisms vary greatly among taxa. It has been proposed
    that genetic sex-determination pathways evolve in reverse order from the
    final step in the pathway to the first step. Consistent with this
    hypothesis, doublesex (dsx), the most downstream gene in the Drosophila
    sex-determination cascade that determines most sexual phenotypes also
    determines sex in other dipterans and the silk moth, while the upstream
    genes vary among these species. However, it is unknown when dsx was
    recruited to the sex-determination pathway during insect evolution.
    Furthermore, sex-specific splicing of dsx, by which dsx determines sex, is
    different in pattern and mechanism between the moth and the fly, raising an
    interesting question of how these insects have kept the executor of sex
    determination while allowing flexibility in the means of execution. To
    address these questions, here we study the dsx gene of the honeybee Apis
    mellifera, a member of the most basal lineage of holometabolous insects. We
    report that honeybee dsx is sex-specifically spliced and that it produces
    both the fly-type and moth-type splicing forms, indicating that the use of
    different splicing forms of Dsx in controlling sexual differentiation was
    present in the common ancestor of holometabolous insects. Our data suggest
    that in ancestral holometabolous insects the female Dsx form is the default
    and the male form is generated by suppressing the splicing of the female
    form. Thus, it is likely that the dsx splicing activator system in flies,
    where the male form is the default, arose during early dipteran evolution.

    In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, the ring gland (RG) is a control center
    that orchestrates major developmental transitions. It is a composite organ,
    consisting of the prothoracic gland, the corpus allatum, and the corpora
    cardiaca, each of which synthesizes and secretes a different hormone. Until
    now, the RG’s broader developmental roles beyond endocrine secretion have
    not been explored. RNA sequencing and analysis of a new transcriptome
    resource from D. melanogaster wandering third instar larval RGs has provided
    a fascinating insight into the diversity of developmental signaling in this
    organ. We have found strong enrichment of expression of two gene pathways
    not previously associated with the RG: immune response and fatty acid
    metabolism. We have also uncovered strong expression for many
    uncharacterized genes. Additionally, RNA interference against RG-enriched
    cytochrome p450s Cyp6u1 and Cyp6g2 produced a lethal ecdysone deficiency and
    a juvenile hormone deficiency, respectively, flagging a critical role for
    these genes in hormone synthesis. This transcriptome provides a valuable new
    resource for investigation of roles played by the RG in governing insect
    development.

    Several articles suggest that DNA methylation levels in blood relate to
    Parkinson’s disease (PD) but there is a need for a large-scale study that
    involves suitable population based controls. The purposes of the study were:
    (1) to study whether PD status is associated with DNA methylation levels in
    blood/saliva; (2) to study whether observed associations relate to blood
    cell types; and (3) to characterize genome-wide significant markers (“CpGs”)
    and clusters of CpGs (co-methylation modules) in terms of biological
    pathways.

    To understand the molecular mechanism regulating meristem development in the
    monocot rice (Oryza sativa), we describe here the isolation and
    characterization of three floral organ number4 (fon4) alleles and the
    cloning of the FON4 gene. The fon4 mutants showed abnormal enlargement of
    the embryonic and vegetative shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and the
    inflorescence and floral meristems. Likely due to enlarged SAMs, fon4
    mutants produced thick culms (stems) and increased numbers of both primary
    rachis branches and floral organs. We identified FON4 using a map-based
    cloning approach and found it encodes a small putatively secreted protein,
    which is the putative ortholog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
    CLAVATA3 (CLV3) gene. FON4 transcripts mainly accumulated in the small group
    of cells at the apex of the SAMs, whereas the rice ortholog of CLV1 (FON1)
    is expressed throughout the SAMs, suggesting that the putative FON4 ligand
    might be sequestered as a possible mechanism for rice meristem regulation.
    Exogenous application of the peptides FON4p and CLV3p corresponding to the
    CLV3/ESR-related (CLE) motifs of FON4 and CLV3, respectively, resulted in
    termination of SAMs in rice, and treatment with CLV3p caused consumption of
    both rice and Arabidopsis root meristems, suggesting that the CLV pathway in
    limiting meristem size is conserved in both rice and Arabidopsis. However,
    exogenous FON4p did not have an obvious effect on limiting both rice and
    Arabidopsis root meristems, suggesting that the CLE motifs of Arabidopsis
    CLV3 and FON4 are potentially functionally divergent.

    Cytochrome P450s form a large and diverse family of heme-containing proteins
    capable of carrying out many different enzymatic reactions. In both mammals
    and plants, some P450s are known to carry out reactions essential for
    processes such as hormone synthesis, while other P450s are involved in the
    detoxification of environmental compounds. In general, functions of insect
    P450s are less well understood. We characterized Drosophila melanogaster
    P450 expression patterns in embryos and 2 stages of third instar larvae. We
    identified numerous P450s expressed in the fat body, Malpighian (renal)
    tubules, and in distinct regions of the midgut, consistent with hypothesized
    roles in detoxification processes, and other P450s expressed in organs such
    as the gonads, corpora allata, oenocytes, hindgut, and brain. Combining
    expression pattern data with an RNA interference lethality screen of
    individual P450s, we identify candidate P450s essential for developmental
    processes and distinguish them from P450s with potential functions in
    detoxification.

    Transposable elements are a major mutation source and powerful agents of
    adaptive change. Some transposable element insertions in genomes increase to
    a high frequency because of the selective advantage the mutant phenotype
    provides. Cyp6g1-mediated insecticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster
    is due to the upregulation of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1, leading to
    the resistance to a variety of insecticide classes. The upregulation of
    Cyp6g1 is correlated with the presence of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of
    an Accord retrotransposon inserted 291bp upstream of the Cyp6g1
    transcription start site. This resistant allele (DDT-R) is currently at a
    high frequency in D. melanogaster populations around the world. Here, we
    characterize the spatial expression of Cyp6g1 in insecticide-resistant and
    -susceptible strains. We show that the Accord LTR insertion is indeed the
    resistance-associated mutation and demonstrate that the Accord LTR carries
    regulatory sequences that increase the expression of Cyp6g1 in tissues
    important for detoxification, the midgut, Malpighian tubules, and the fat
    body. This study provides a significant example of how changes in
    tissue-specific gene expression caused by transposable-element insertions
    can contribute to adaptation.

  abstract: >-
    Organisms induce the expression of detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome
    P450s to deal with xenobiotics encountered in the environment. Research
    using cell culture systems has identified some of the cis-regulatory
    elements (CREs) and transcription factors involved in the induction of P450
    genes in response to xenobiotic challenges. It was recently found that the
    CREs required for the basal expression of some P450s are distinct from the
    CREs involved in their induction. How these CREs mediate induction to
    xenobiotics in a tissue specific manner is not known. In this paper we show
    that, in Drosophila melanogaster, the induction response of the P450 gene
    Cyp6g1 to the xenobiotic Phenobarbital (PB) requires the presence of both
    tissue specific enhancers and a distinct CRE. The CRE does not drive gene
    expression but is required for the induction response. Site-directed
    mutagenesis of sequences within the CRE, sequences similar to mouse PB
    induction sequences, reduces the level of induction by PB, suggesting some
    degree of mechanistic conservation between flies and mice. This CRE may
    represent a unique class of CREs that has no inherent role in the basal
    transcriptional activity of genes, but is required for induction responses.
    Variations within this class of CREs may explain the variability of gene
    induction responses.

  abstract: >-
    Drosophila segmentation is a well-established paradigm for developmental
    pattern formation. However, the later stages of segment patterning,
    regulated by the “pair-rule” genes, are still not well understood at the
    system level. Building on established genetic interactions, I construct a
    logical model of the Drosophila pair-rule system that takes into account the
    demonstrated stage-specific architecture of the pair-rule gene network.
    Simulation of this model can accurately recapitulate the observed
    spatiotemporal expression of the pair-rule genes, but only when the system
    is provided with dynamic “gap” inputs. This result suggests that dynamic
    shifts of pair-rule stripes are essential for segment patterning in the
    trunk and provides a functional role for observed posterior-to-anterior gap
    domain shifts that occur during cellularisation. The model also suggests
    revised patterning mechanisms for the parasegment boundaries and explains
    the aetiology of the even-skipped null mutant phenotype. Strikingly, a
    slightly modified version of the model is able to pattern segments in either
    simultaneous or sequential modes, depending only on initial conditions. This
    suggests that fundamentally similar mechanisms may underlie segmentation in
    short-germ and long-germ arthropods.

    This protocol describes how to perform basic statistical analysis in a
    population-based genetic association case-control study. The steps described
    involve the (i) appropriate selection of measures of association and
    relevance of disease models; (ii) appropriate selection of tests of
    association; (iii) visualization and interpretation of results; (iv)
    consideration of appropriate methods to control for multiple testing; and
    (v) replication strategies. Assuming no previous experience with software
    such as PLINK, R or Haploview, we describe how to use these popular tools
    for handling single-nucleotide polymorphism data in order to carry out tests
    of association and visualize and interpret results. This protocol assumes
    that data quality assessment and control has been performed, as described in
    a previous protocol, so that samples and markers deemed to have the
    potential to introduce bias to the study have been identified and removed.
    Study design, marker selection and quality control of case-control studies
    have also been discussed in earlier protocols. The protocol should take
    \textasciitilde1 h to complete.

  abstract: >-
    Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework
    dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary
    inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can
    provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented
    here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae,
    persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how
    rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate
    evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment
    the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a
    pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental
    research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease,
    neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable
    similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively
    non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and
    cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the
    ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.

  abstract: "The honeybee genome has substantially fewer protein coding genes (≈\_11\_000 genes) than Drosophila melanogaster (≈\_13\_500) and Anopheles gambiae (≈\_14\_000). Some of the most marked differences occur in three superfamilies encoding xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes. Specifically there are only about half as many glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) and carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCEs) in the honeybee. This includes 10-fold or greater shortfalls in the numbers of Delta and Epsilon GSTs and CYP4 P450s, members of which clades have been recurrently associated with insecticide resistance in other species. These shortfalls may contribute to the sensitivity of the honeybee to insecticides. On the other hand there are some recent radiations in CYP6, CYP9 and certain CCE clades in A. mellifera that could be associated with the evolution of the hormonal and chemosensory processes underpinning its highly organized eusociality."

  abstract: >-
    Organophosphate (OP) insecticide resistance in certain strains of Musca
    domestica is associated with reduction in the carboxylesterase activity of a
    particular esterase isozyme. This has been attributed to a 'mutant
    ali-esterase hypothesis', which invokes a structural mutation to an
    ali-esterase resulting in the loss of its carboxylesterase activity but
    acquisition of OP hydrolase activity. It has been shown that the mutation in
    Lucilia cuprina is a Gly(137)–>Asp substitution in the active site of an
    esterase encoded by the Lc alpha E7 gene (Newcomb, R.D., Campbell, P.M.,
    Ollis, D.L., Cheah, E., Russell, R.J., Oakeshott, J.G., 1997. A single amino
    acid substitution converts a carboxylesterase to an organophosphate
    hydrolase and confers insecticide resistance on a blowfly. Proc. Natl. Acad.
    Sci. USA 94, 7464-7468). We now report the cloning and characterisation of
    the orthologous M. domestica Md alpha E7 gene, including the sequencing of
    cDNAs from the OP resistant Rutgers and OP susceptible sbo and WHO strains.
    The Md alpha E7 gene has the same intron structure as Lc alpha E7 and
    encodes a protein with 76% amino acid identity to Lc alpha E7. Comparisons
    between susceptible and resistance alleles show resistance in M. domestica
    is associated with the same Gly(137)–>Asp mutation as in L. cuprina.
    Bacterial expression of the Rutgers allele shows its product has OP
    hydrolase activity. The data indicate identical catalytic mechanisms have
    evolved in orthologous Md alpha E7 and Lc alpha E7 molecules to endow
    diazinon-type resistance on the two species of higher Diptera. (C) 1999

  abstract: >-
    Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are complex photosynthetic organisms with a very
    different evolutionary history to green plants, to which they are only
    distantly related. These seaweeds are the dominant species in rocky coastal
    ecosystems and they exhibit many interesting adaptations to these, often
    harsh, environments. Brown algae are also one of only a small number of
    eukaryotic lineages that have evolved complex multicellularity (Fig. 1). We
    report the 214 million base pair (Mbp) genome sequence of the filamentous
    seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus (Dillwyn) Lyngbye, a model organism for brown
    algae, closely related to the kelps (Fig. 1). Genome features such as the
    presence of an extended set of light-harvesting and pigment biosynthesis
    genes and new metabolic processes such as halide metabolism help explain the
    ability of this organism to cope with the highly variable tidal environment.
    The evolution of multicellularity in this lineage is correlated with the
    presence of a rich array of signal transduction genes. Of particular
    interest is the presence of a family of receptor kinases, as the independent
    evolution of related molecules has been linked with the emergence of
    multicellularity in both the animal and green plant lineages. The Ectocarpus
    genome sequence represents an important step towards developing this
    organism as a model species, providing the possibility to combine genomic
    and genetic approaches to explore these and other aspects of brown algal
    biology further.

  abstract: >-
    Plants carrying the floricaula (flo) mutation cannot make the transition
    from inflorescence to floral meristems and have indeterminate shoots in
    place of flowers. The flo-613 allele carries a Tam3 transposon insertion,
    which allowed the isolation of the flo locus. The flo gene encodes a
    putative protein (FLO) containing a proline-rich N-terminus and a highly
    acidic region. In situ hybridization shows that the flo gene is transiently
    expressed in the very early stages of flower development. The earliest
    expression seen is in bract primordia, followed by sepal, petal, and carpel
    primordia, but no expression is detected in stamen primordia. This pattern
    of expression has implications for how flo affects phyllotaxis, organ
    identity, and determinacy. We propose that flo interacts in a sequential
    manner with other homeotic genes affecting floral organ identity.

    The analysis of mutations affecting flower structure has led to the
    identification of some of the genes that direct flower development. Cloning
    of these genes has allowed the formulation of molecular models of how floral
    meristem and organ identity may be specified, and has shown that the
    distantly related flowering plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum

    A cluster of genes of the CYP6 family was found in a series of overlapping
    lambda DASH clones from a genomic library of the house fly, Musca domestica,
    Four complete genes, CYP6A3, CYP6A4, CYP6A5, and CYP6C1, and fragments of
    two other genes, CYP6A6 and CYP6C2, were closely linked on a 24-kb segment
    of DNA, Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of
    PCR-amplified segments of two of the genes showed that the cluster is
    localized on chromosome V of the house fly, Each gene contained a short
    intron of 57 to 125 bp interrupting a conserved Glu codon, as in the
    previously described CYP6A1 gene, The gene fragment CYP6A6 consisted only of
    the coding region downstream from this intron, i.e., about one-third of the
    complete P450, The gene fragment CYP6C2 was missing a short amino-terminal
    part of the coding region, and may represent the two last exons of a larger
    gene, Gene duplication and chromosomal inversion events may explain the
    origin of this cluster, The P450 proteins deduced from the nucleotide
    sequences shared 39-71% amino acid identity with each other, This low
    identity and the lack of evidence of recent gene conversion events suggested
    that this cluster may be evolutionarily ancient and that homologous clusters
    may be found in other holometabolous insects, Evidence for transcription of
    the genes and for correct splicing of the introns was obtained by northern
    blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
    experiments, No overexpression was observed in any of three
    insecticide-resistant house fly strains, RT-PCR and sequencing also revealed
    the existence of other genes or alleles closely related to the members of
    this cluster.

    The trace biogenic amine tyramine is present in the nervous systems of
    animals ranging in complexity from nematodes to mammals. Tyramine is
    synthesized from tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC), a
    member of the aromatic amino acid family, but this enzyme has not been
    identified in Drosophila or in higher animals. To further clarify the roles
    of tyramine and its metabolite octopamine, we have cloned two TDC genes from
    Drosophila melanogaster, dTdc1 and dTdc2. Although both gene products have
    TDC activity in vivo, dTdc1 is expressed nonneurally, whereas dTdc2 is
    expressed neurally. Flies with a mutation in dTdc2 lack neural tyramine and
    octopamine and are female sterile due to egg retention. Although other
    Drosophila mutants that lack octopamine retain eggs completely within the
    ovaries, dTdc2 mutants release eggs into the oviducts but are unable to
    deposit them. This specific sterility phenotype can be partially rescued by
    driving the expression of dTdc2 in a dTdc2-specific pattern, whereas driving
    the expression of dTdc1 in the same pattern results in a complete rescue.
    The disparity in rescue efficiencies between the ectopically expressed Tdc
    genes may reflect the differential activities of these gene products. The
    egg retention phenotype of the dTdc2 mutant and the phenotypes associated
    with ectopic dTdc expression contribute to a model in which octopamine and
    tyramine have distinct and separable neural activities.

    Red seaweeds are key components of coastal ecosystems and are economically
    important as food and as a source of gelling agents, but their genes and
    genomes have received little attention. Here we report the sequencing of the
    105-Mbp genome of the florideophyte Chondrus crispus (Irish moss) and the
    annotation of the 9,606 genes. The genome features an unusual structure
    characterized by gene-dense regions surrounded by repeat-rich regions
    dominated by transposable elements. Despite its fairly large size, this
    genome shows features typical of compact genomes, e.g., on average only 0.3
    introns per gene, short introns, low median distance between genes, small
    gene families, and no indication of large-scale genome duplication. The
    genome also gives insights into the metabolism of marine red algae and
    adaptations to the marine environment, including genes related to halogen
    metabolism, oxylipins, and multicellularity (microRNA processing and
    transcription factors). Particularly interesting are features related to
    carbohydrate metabolism, which include a minimalistic gene set for starch
    biosynthesis, the presence of cellulose synthases acquired before the
    primary endosymbiosis showing the polyphyly of cellulose synthesis in
    Archaeplastida, and cellulases absent in terrestrial plants as well as the
    occurrence of a mannosylglycerate synthase potentially originating from a
    marine bacterium. To explain the observations on genome structure and gene
    content, we propose an evolutionary scenario involving an ancestral red alga
    that was driven by early ecological forces to lose genes, introns, and
    intergenetic DNA; this loss was followed by an expansion of genome size as a
    consequence of activity of transposable elements.

  abstract: >-
    Intertidal seaweeds inhabit an inherently stressful environment with rapidly
    changing physical conditions with the turning tides. Many macroalgae are
    therefore very resistant to abiotic stress; however, the bases for this
    tolerance and the relative importance of different stressors are largely
    unknown. Here, the effects of stress on the transcriptome of the red seaweed
    Chondrus crispus were investigated using cDNA microarrays. The responses
    were studied after exposure to high light, high temperature, and hypo- and
    hyperosmotic conditions in the laboratory and compared with gene expression
    in nature at different stress loads: at high and low tide at solar noon, and
    during a cloudy and a sunny day, respectively. The study identifies key
    stress genes and marker genes for specific stressors. The data also provide
    an insight into the physiological effects of stress; for example, high light
    stress and high natural stress caused an increase in antioxidative proteins,
    suggesting an increased oxidative stress. Clustering analysis suggested that
    osmotic stress modulated the gene expression in nature under high-stress
    conditions and was thus the most significant natural stressor. The potential
    cross-talk between stress reactions and methyl jasmonate-induced responses
    was also investigated and is tentatively suggested to be mediated by
    reactive oxygen species.

    Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) represses the transcriptional activity
    of target genes through trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3. The
    functions of plant PRC2 have been chiefly described in Arabidopsis, but
    specific functions in other plant species, especially cereals, are still
    largely unknown. Here we characterize mutants in the rice EMF2B gene, an
    ortholog of the Arabidopsis EMBRYONIC FLOWER2 (EMF2) gene. Loss of EMF2B in
    rice results in complete sterility, and mutant flowers have severe floral
    organ defects and indeterminacy that resemble loss-of-function mutants in
    E-function floral organ specification genes. Transcriptome analysis
    identified the E-function genes OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS34 as
    differentially expressed in the emf2b mutant compared with wild type.
    OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, known to be required for meristem determinacy in rice,
    have reduced expression in the emf2b mutant, whereas OsMADS34 which
    interacts genetically with OsMADS1 was ectopically expressed. Chromatin
    immunoprecipitation for H3K27me3 followed by quantitative (q)RT-PCR showed
    that all three genes are presumptive targets of PRC2 in the meristem.
    Therefore, in rice, and possibly other cereals, PRC2 appears to play a major
    role in floral meristem determinacy through modulation of the expression of
    E-function genes.

    The Plant Ontology (PO; http://www.plantontology.org/) is a publicly
    available, collaborative effort to develop and maintain a controlled,
    structured vocabulary ('ontology') of terms to describe plant anatomy,
    morphology and the stages of plant development. The goals of the PO are to
    link (annotate) gene expression and phenotype data to plant structures and
    stages of plant development, using the data model adopted by the Gene
    Ontology. From its original design covering only rice, maize and
    Arabidopsis, the scope of the PO has been expanded to include all green
    plants. The PO was the first multispecies anatomy ontology developed for the
    annotation of genes and phenotypes. Also, to our knowledge, it was one of
    the first biological ontologies that provides translations (via synonyms) in
    non-English languages such as Japanese and Spanish. As of Release #18 (July
    2012), there are about 2.2 million annotations linking PO terms to >110,000
    unique data objects representing genes or gene models, proteins, RNAs,
    germplasm and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from 22 plant species. In this
    paper, we focus on the plant anatomical entity branch of the PO, describing
    the organizing principles, resources available to users and examples of how
    the PO is integrated into other plant genomics databases and web portals. We
    also provide two examples of comparative analyses, demonstrating how the
    ontology structure and PO-annotated data can be used to discover the
    patterns of expression of the LEAFY (LFY) and terpene synthase (TPS) gene
    homologs.

  abstract: >-
    Wolbachia are intracellular, maternally inherited bacteria with an
    impressive history of adaptation to intracellular lifestyles. Instead of
    adapting to a single host lineage, Wolbachia evolved ways to jump across
    host species and establish relatively stable associations maintained through
    vertical transmission. Wolbachia are capable of manipulating the
    reproduction of infected hosts in a remarkable way. Traditionally, such
    reproductive manipulations have been regarded as the general mechanism by
    which Wolbachia spread through host populations. Recent evidence suggests
    that Wolbachia-host interactions are more complex than previously thought
    and may be driven by the onset and resolution of conflicts of interest.
    Here, we discuss how reproductive manipulation phenotypes may be transient.
    As the host adapts to infection, manipulation phenotypes attenuate and the
    continuity of the symbioses may rely on the physiological advantages
    Wolbachia may confer to their host. For facultative symbionts, such benefits
    are likely to be dependent on the environment. Here, we also review evidence
    that supports the view of environment-dependent facultative mutualism as a
    stable evolutionary outcome of Wolbachia infections beside extinction and
    obligate symbioses. Finally, our current understanding of the biology of
    mitochondria and Wolbachia unravels remarkable parallels in the way they
    interact with the nuclear genome. Great insights into both the Wolbachia and
    mitochondrial research fields can be revealed if such fields are considered
    to be overlapping, rather than independent from each other.

    Understanding the emergence of biological structures and their changes is a
    complex problem. On a biochemical level, it is based on gene regulatory
    networks (GRN) consisting on interactions between the genes responsible for
    cell differentiation and coupled in a greater scale with external factors.
    In this work we provide a systematic methodological framework to construct
    Waddington’s epigenetic landscape of the GRN involved in cellular
    determination during the early stages of development of angiosperms. As a
    specific example we consider the flower of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
    Our model, which is based on experimental data, recovers accurately the
    spatial configuration of the flower during cell fate determination, not only
    for the wild type, but for its homeotic mutants as well. The method
    developed in this project is general enough to be used in the study of the
    relationship between genotype-phenotype in other living organisms.

    Background The remarkable similarity of animal embryos at particular stages
    of development led to the proposal of a developmental hourglass. In this
    model, early events in development are less conserved across species but
    lead to a highly conserved ‘phylotypic period’. Beyond this stage, the model
    suggests that development once again becomes less conserved, leading to the
    diversity of forms. Recent comparative studies of gene expression in animal
    groups have provided strong support for the hourglass model. How and why
    might such an hourglass pattern be generated? More importantly, how might
    early acting events in development evolve while still maintaining a later
    conserved stage?Scope The discovery that an hourglass pattern may also exist
    in the embryogenesis of plants provides comparative data that may help us
    explain this phenomenon. Whether the developmental hourglass occurs in
    plants, and what this means for our understanding of embryogenesis in plants
    and animals is discussed. Models by which conserved early-acting genes might
    change their functional role in the evolution of gene networks, how networks
    buffer these changes, and how that might constrain, or confer diversity, of
    the body plan are also discused.Conclusions Evidence of a morphological and
    molecular hourglass in plant and animal embryogenesis suggests convergent
    evolution. This convergence is likely due to developmental constraints
    imposed upon embryogenesis by the need to produce a viable embryo with an
    established body plan, controlled by the architecture of the underlying gene
    regulatory networks. As the body plan is largely laid down during the middle
    phases of embryo development in plants and animals, then it is perhaps not
    surprising this stage represents the narrow waist of the hourglass where the
    gene regulatory networks are the oldest and most robust and integrated,
    limiting species diversity and constraining morphological space.

    Honeybees are an important component of modern agricultural systems, and a
    fascinating and scientifically engrossing insect. Honeybees are not commonly
    used as model systems for understanding development in insects despite their
    importance in agriculture. Honeybee embryogenesis, while being superficially
    similar to Drosophila, is molecularly very different, especially in axis
    formation and sex determination. In later development, much of honeybee
    biology is modified by caste development, an as yet poorly understood, but
    excellent, system to study developmental plasticity. In adult stages,
    developmental plasticity of the ovaries, related to reproductive constraint
    exhibits another aspect of plasticity. Here they review the tools, current
    knowledge and opportunities in honeybee developmental biology, and provide
    an updated embryonic staging scheme to support future studies.

    Insects provide valuable model systems to help us understand the effects of
    nutrition on body form and life history traits. Insects often show very
    pronounced, extreme differences in phenotype in response to nutritional
    cues, and in recent years epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed as key to
    these responses. Here we review the links between nutrition, epigenetic
    change, and phenotype in a range of insects, focusing on evidence for
    epigenetic change linking nutrition and phenotype. While evidence exists
    that epigenetics plays a key role in responding to nutrition, we suggest
    that investigating the chain of causality from nutritional change to
    epigenetic change to phenotype is required before we can understand the role
    of epigenetics in insect nutrition.

    Many insects are capable of remarkable changes in biology and form in
    response to their environment or diet. The most extreme example of these are
    polyphenisms, which are when two or more different phenotypes are produced
    from a single genotype in response to the environment. Polyphenisms provide
    a fascinating opportunity to study how the environment affects an animal’s
    genome, and how this produces changes in form. Here we review the current
    state of knowledge of the molecular basis of polyphenisms and what can be
    learnt from them to understand how nutrition may influence our own genomes.

  abstract: >-
    In the modern world, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death for
    both men and women. Epidemiologic studies consistently have suggested an
    association between low birthweight and/or fetal growth restriction and
    increased rate of cardiovascular mortality in adulthood. Furthermore,
    experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that sustained nutrient
    and oxygen restriction that are associated with fetal growth restriction
    activate adaptive cardiovascular changes that might explain this
    association. Fetal growth restriction results in metabolic programming that
    may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and, consequently, of
    cardiovascular morbidity in the adult. In addition, fetal growth restriction
    is strongly associated with fetal cardiac and arterial remodeling and a
    subclinical state of cardiovascular dysfunction. The cardiovascular effects
    ocurring in fetal life, includes cardiac morphology changes, subclinical
    myocardial dysfunction, arterial remodeling, and impaired endothelial
    function, persist into childhood and adolescence. Importantly, these changes
    have been described in all clinical presentations of fetal growth
    restriction, from severe early- to milder late-onset forms. In this review
    we summarize the current evidence on the cardiovascular effects of fetal
    growth restriction, from subcellular to organ structure and function as well
    as from fetal to early postnatal life. Future research needs to elucidate
    whether and how early life cardiovascular remodeling persists into adulthood
    and determines the increased cardiovascular mortality rate described in
    epidemiologic studies.

    Rice panicle architecture is a key target of selection when breeding for
    yield and grain quality. However, panicle phenotypes are difficult to
    measure and susceptible to confounding during genetic mapping due to
    correlation with flowering and subpopulation structure. Here we quantify 49
    panicle phenotypes in 242 tropical rice accessions with the imaging platform
    PANorama. Using flowering as a covariate, we conduct a genome-wide
    association study (GWAS), detect numerous subpopulation-specific
    associations, and dissect multi-trait peaks using panicle phenotype
    covariates. Ten candidate genes in pathways known to regulate plant
    architecture fall under GWAS peaks, half of which overlap with quantitative
    trait loci identified in an experimental population. This is the first study
    to assess inflorescence phenotypes of field-grown material using a
    high-resolution phenotyping platform. Herein, we establish a panicle
    morphocline for domesticated rice, propose a genetic model underlying
    complex panicle traits, and demonstrate subtle links between panicle size
    and yield performance.

    Until now, the potential of NGS for the construction of barcode libraries or
    integrative taxonomy has been seldom realised. Here, we amplified (two-step
    PCR) and simultaneously sequenced (MiSeq) multiple markers from hundreds of
    fig wasp specimens. We also developed a workflow for quality control of the
    data. Illumina and Sanger sequences accumulated in the past years were
    compared. Interestingly, primers and PCR conditions used for the Sanger
    approach did not require optimisation to construct the MiSeq library. After
    quality controls, 87% of the species (76% of the specimens) had a valid
    MiSeq sequence for each marker. Importantly, major clusters did not always
    correspond to the targeted loci. Nine specimens exhibited two divergent
    sequences (up to 10%). In 95% of the species, MiSeq and Sanger sequences
    obtained from the same sampling were similar. For the remaining 5%, species
    were paraphyletic or the sequences clustered into divergent groups on the
    Sanger + MiSeq trees (>7%). These problematic cases may represent coding
    NUMTS or heteroplasms. Our results illustrate that Illumina approaches are
    not artefact-free and confirm that Sanger databases can contain non-target
    genes. This highlights the importance of quality controls, working with
    taxonomists and using multiple markers for DNA-taxonomy or species diversity
    assessment.

    proportion, 44% and 25%, of the uniquely alignable rmRNA-seq reads, is in
    intergenic and intronic regions, respectively, as compared to 23% and 15%
    from the mRNA-seq dataset. Further analysis made an additional discovery of
    transcripts of protein-coding genes (such as Histone, Heg1, and Dux),
    ncRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, and novel ncRNAs as well as repeat elements in
    rmRNA-seq dataset. This result suggests that rmRNA-seq method should detect
    more polyA- or bimorphic transcripts. Finally, through comparative analyses
    of gene expression profiles among multiple datasets, we demonstrated that
    different RNA sample preparations may result in significant variations in
    gene expression profiles.

    Mutant analyses in different eudicotyledonous flowering plants demonstrated
    that SEPALLATA-like MADS-box genes are required for the specification of
    sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, and for floral determinacy, thus
    defining class E floral organ identity genes. SEP-like genes encode
    MADS-domain transcription factors and constitute an angiosperm-specific gene
    clade whose members show remarkably different degrees of redundancy and
    sub-functionalization within eudicots. To better understand the evolutionary
    dynamics of SEP-like genes throughout the angiosperms we have knocked down
    SEP-like genes of rice (Oryza sativa), a distant relative of eudicots within
    the flowering plants. Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show
    severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules,
    stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral
    determinacy. Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1,
    OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral
    organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs. This mimics the phenotype
    observed with the sep1 sep2 sep3 sep4 quadruple mutant of Arabidopsis.
    Detailed analyses of the spatial and temporal mRNA expression and protein
    interaction patterns corresponding to the different rice SEP-like genes show
    strong similarities, but also gene-specific differences. These findings
    reveal conservation of SEP-like genes in specifying floral determinacy and
    organ identities since the separation of eudicots and monocots about 150
    million years ago. However, they indicate also monocot-specific neo- and
    sub-functionalization events and hence underscore the evolutionary dynamics
    of SEP-like genes. Moreover, our findings corroborate the view that the
    lodicules of grasses are homologous to eudicot petals.

    Error bars commonly appear in figures in publications, but experimental
    biologists are often unsure how they should be used and interpreted. In this
    article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they
    can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may
    show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other
    quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information,
    and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest
    eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error
    bars.

    Understanding how gene regulatory networks control the progressive
    restriction of cell fates is a long-standing challenge. Recent advances in
    measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into
    lineage commitment. However, the regulatory events underlying these changes
    remain unclear. Here we investigate the dynamics of chromatin regulatory
    landscapes during embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell
    combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin with
    sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq)1, we profiled chromatin accessibility in over
    20,000 single nuclei from fixed Drosophila melanogaster embryos spanning
    three landmark embryonic stages: 2–4 h after egg laying (predominantly stage
    5 blastoderm nuclei), when each embryo comprises around 6,000 multipotent
    cells; 6–8 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 10–11), to capture a
    midpoint in embryonic development when major lineages in the mesoderm and
    ectoderm are specified; and 10–12 h after egg laying (predominantly stage
    13), when each of the embryo’s more than 20,000 cells are undergoing
    terminal differentiation. Our results show that there is spatial
    heterogeneity in the accessibility of the regulatory genome before
    gastrulation, a feature that aligns with future cell fate, and that nuclei
    can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. During
    mid-embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that individual cell
    types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility while maintaining a
    signature of their germ layer of origin. Analysis of the data reveals
    overlapping usage of regulatory elements between cells of the endoderm and
    non-myogenic mesoderm, suggesting a common developmental program that is
    reminiscent of the mesendoderm lineage in other species2,3,4. We identify
    30,075 distal regulatory elements that exhibit tissue-specific
    accessibility. We validated the germ-layer specificity of a subset of these
    predicted enhancers in transgenic embryos, achieving an accuracy of 90%.
    Overall, our results demonstrate the power of shotgun single-cell profiling
    of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during
    development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of metazoan germ
    layers and cell types.

    Chromatin state and the single cell

    Identifying the chromatin state of any single cell, which may or may not
    have a different function or represent different stages relative to others
    collected within any single culture, experiment, or tissue, has been
    challenging. Cusanovitch et al. skirted previously identified technological
    limitations to identify regions of accessible chromatin at single-cell
    resolution. Combinatorial cellular indexing, a strategy for multiplex
    barcoding of thousands of single cells per experiment, was successfully used
    to investigate the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape in each of
    over 15,000 single cells.

    Science, this issue p. 910

    Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome
    data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization
    of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must
    be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional
    single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial
    cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single
    cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of
    individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than
    15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of
    chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately
    regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between
    and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress
    toward a human cell atlas.

    Combinatorial indexing can identify chromatin states at single-cell
    resolution.

    The venom gland is a ubiquitous organ in Hymenoptera. In insect parasitoids,
    the venom gland has been shown to have multiple functions including
    regulation of host immune response, host paralysis, host castration and
    developmental alteration. However, the role played by the venom gland has
    been mainly studied in parasitoids developing in larval or pupal hosts while
    little is known for parasitoids developing in insect eggs. We conducted the
    first extensive characterization of the venom of the endoparasitoid
    Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev), a species that develops in eggs of the
    stink bug Nezara viridula (L.). In particular we investigated the structure
    of the venom apparatus, its functional role and conducted a transcriptomic
    analysis of the venom gland. We found that injection of O. telenomicida
    venom induces: 1) a melanized-like process in N. viridula host eggs
    (host-parasitoid interaction), 2) impairment of the larval development of
    the competitor Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (parasitoid-parasitoid
    interaction). The O. telenomicida venom gland transcriptome reveals a
    majority of digestive enzymes (peptidases and glycosylases) and
    oxidoreductases (laccases) among the most expressed genes. The former
    enzymes are likely to be involved in degradation of the host resources for
    the specific benefit of the O. telenomicida offspring. In turn, alteration
    of host resources caused by these enzymes may negatively affect the larval
    development of the competitor T. basalis. We hypothesize that the
    melanization process induced by venom injection could be related to the
    presence of laccases, which are multicopper oxidases that belong to the
    phenoloxidases group. This work contributed to a better understanding of the
    venom in insect parasitoids and allowed to identify candidate genes whose
    functional role can be investigated in future studies.

    . Mutagenesis can be used as a means of predicting likely mechanisms of
    resistance to novel classes of insecticides. We used chemical mutagenesis in
    Drosophila to screen for mutants that had become resistant to imidacloprid,
    a neonicotinoid insecticide. Here we report the isolation of two new
    dominant imidacloprid-resistant mutants. By recombinational mapping we show
    that these map to the same location as Rst(2)DDT. Furthermore, we show that
    pre-existing Rst(2)DDT alleles in turn confer cross-resistance to
    imidacloprid. In order to localize the Rst(2)DDT gene more precisely, we
    mapped resistance to both DDT and imidacloprid with respect to P-element
    markers whose genomic location is known. By screening for recombinants
    between these P-elements and resistance we localized the gene between 48D5–6
    and 48F3–6 on the polytene chromosome map. The genomic sequence in this
    interval shows a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes, one of which, Cyp6g1, is
    over-expressed in all resistant strains examined. We are now testing the
    hypothesis that resistance to both compounds is associated with
    over-expression of this P450 gene.

    In Drosophila melanogaster, the increased expression of Cyp6g1 results in
    resistance to chemically unrelated insecticides including DDT,
    neonicotinoids and insect growth regulator insecticides. To determine the
    insecticide resistance capacity of other D. melanogaster cytochrome P450s,
    we used the GAL4/UAS system to express individual P450s in the midgut,
    Malpighian tubules and fat body of transgenic flies. Drosophila
    over-expressing Cyp6g1, Cyp6g2, Cyp6t3, Cyp6a2, Cyp6a8, Cyp6a19, Cyp6a23 and
    Cyp12d1 were screened for resistance to four insecticides—DDT, nitenpyram,
    dicyclanil and diazinon. Increased survival on insecticides is detected for
    Cyp6g1 (DDT, nitenpyram and dicyclanil), Cyp6g2 (nitenpyram and diazinon)
    and Cyp12d1 (DDT and dicyclanil) over-expression lines. No increased
    survival on any insecticide was detected for flies over-expressing either
    Cyp6a2, Cyp6a8, Cyp6t3, Cyp6a19 or Cyp6a23.

  abstract: >-
    Insecticide resistance is one of the most widespread genetic changes caused
    by human activity, but we still understand little about the origins and
    spread of resistant alleles in global populations of insects. Here, via
    microarray analysis of all P450s in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that
    DDT-R, a gene conferring resistance to DDT, is associated with
    overtranscription of a single cytochrome P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Transgenic
    analysis ofCyp6g1 shows that overtranscription of this gene alone is both
    necessary and sufficient for resistance. Resistance and up-regulation in
    Drosophila populations are associated with a single Cyp6g1 allele that has
    spread globally. This allele is characterized by the insertion of an Accord
    transposable element into the 5′ end of the Cyp6g1 gene.

  abstract: "Identifying molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance is important for preserving insecticide efficacy, developing new insecticides and implementing insect control. The metabolic detoxification of insecticides is a widespread resistance mechanism. Enzymes with the potential to detoxify insecticides are commonly encoded by members of the large cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase gene families, all rapidly evolving in insects. Here, we demonstrate that the model insect Drosophila melanogaster is useful for functionally validating the role of metabolic enzymes in conferring metabolism-based insecticide resistance. Alleles of three well-characterized genes from different pest insects were expressed in transgenic D.\_melanogaster : a carboxylesterase gene (αE7) from the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina, a glutathione S-transferase gene (GstE2) from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and a cytochrome P450 gene (Cyp6cm1) from the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. For all genes, expression in D.\_melanogaster resulted in insecticide resistance phenotypes mirroring those observed in resistant populations of the pest species. Using D.\_melanogaster to assess the potential for novel metabolic resistance mechanisms to evolve in pest species is discussed."

    messenger RNA (mRNA) amplification method, Ribo-SPIA, which generates
    micrograms of labeled cDNA from 5 ng of total RNA in 1 day for analysis on
    arrays or by PCR quantification. Highly reproducible GeneChip array
    performance (R2 > 0.95) was achieved with independent reactions starting
    with 5-100 ng Universal Human Reference total RNA. Targets prepared by the
    Ribo-SPIA procedure (20 ng total RNA input) or the Affymetrix Standard
    Protocol (10 microg total RNA) perform similarly, as indicated by gene call
    concordance (86%) and good correlation of differential gene expression
    determination (R2 = 0.82). Accuracy of transcript representation in cDNA
    generated by the Ribo-SPIA procedure was also demonstrated by PCR
    quantification of 33 transcripts, comparing differential expression in
    amplified and nonamplified cDNA (R2 = 0.97 over a range of nearly 10(6)
    infold change). Thus Ribo-SPIA amplification of mRNA is rapid, robust,
    highly accurate and reproducible, and sensitive enough to allow
    quantification of very low abundance transcripts.

    The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized genomic
    and transcriptomic approaches to biology. These new sequencing tools are
    also valuable for the discovery, validation and assessment of genetic
    markers in populations. Here we review and discuss best practices for
    several NGS methods for genome-wide genetic marker development and
    genotyping that use restriction enzyme digestion of target genomes to reduce
    the complexity of the target. These new methods – which include
    reduced-representation sequencing using reduced-representation libraries
    (RRLs) or complexity reduction of polymorphic sequences (CRoPS),
    restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and low coverage
    genotyping – are applicable to both model organisms with high-quality
    reference genome sequences and, excitingly, to non-model species with no
    existing genomic data.

    Background: The control of mosquitoes transmitting infectious diseases
    relies mainly on the use of chemical insecticides. However, mosquito control
    programs are now threatened by the emergence of insecticide resistance.
    Hitherto, most research efforts have been focused on elucidating the
    molecular basis of inherited resistance. Less attention has been paid to the
    short-term response of mosquitoes to insecticides and pollutants which could
    have a significant impact on insecticide efficacy. Here, a combination of
    LongSAGE and Solexa sequencing was used to perform a deep transcriptome
    analysis of larvae of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti exposed for 48 h to
    sub-lethal doses of three chemical insecticides and three anthropogenic
    pollutants.Results: Thirty millions 20 bp cDNA tags were sequenced, mapped
    to the mosquito genome and clustered, representing 6850 known genes and 4868
    additional clusters not located within predicted genes. Mosquitoes exposed
    to insecticides or anthropogenic pollutants showed considerable
    modifications of their transcriptome. Genes encoding cuticular proteins,
    transporters, and enzymes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain
    and detoxification processes were particularly affected. Genes and molecular
    mechanisms potentially involved in xenobiotic response and insecticide
    tolerance were identified.Conclusions: The method used in the present study
    appears as a powerful approach for investigating fine transcriptome
    variations in genome-sequenced organisms and can provide useful informations
    for the detection of novel transcripts. At the biological level, despite low
    concentrations and no apparent phenotypic effects, the significant impact of
    these xenobiotics on mosquito transcriptomes raise important questions about
    the 'hidden impact' of anthropogenic pollutants on ecosystems and
    consequences on vector control.

    Differentiation and morphogenetic processes during plant development are
    particularly robust. At the cellular level, however, plants also show great
    plasticity in response to environmental conditions, and can even reverse
    apparently terminal differentiated states with remarkable ease. Can we
    understand and predict both robust and plastic systemic responses as a
    general consequence of the non-trivial interplay between intracellular
    regulatory networks, extrinsic environmental signalling, and tissue-level
    mechanical constraints? Flower development has become an ideal model system
    to study these general questions of developmental biology, which are
    especially relevant to understanding stem cell patterning in plants,
    animals, and human disease. Decades of detailed study of molecular
    developmental genetics, as well as novel experimental techniques forin
    vivoassays in both wild-type and mutant plants, enable the postulation and
    testing of experimentally grounded mathematical and computational network
    dynamical models. Research in our group aims to explain the emergence of
    robust transitions that occur at the shoot apical meristem, as well as
    flower development, as the result of the collective action of key molecular
    components in regulatory networks subjected to intra-organismal signalling
    and extracellular constraints. Here we present a brief overview of recent
    work from our group, and that of others, focusing on the use of simple
    dynamical models to address cell-fate specification and cell-state
    stochastic dynamics during flowering transition and cell-state transitions
    at the shoot apical meristem ofArabidopsis thaliana.We also focus on how our
    work fits within the general field of plant developmental modelling, which
    is being developed by many others.

    The gene regulatory network of floral organ cell fate specification of
    Arabidopsis thaliana is a robust developmental regulatory module. Although
    such finding was proposed to explain the overall conservation of floral
    organ types and organization among angiosperms, it has not been confirmed
    that the network components are conserved at the molecular level among
    flowering plants. Using the genomic data that have accumulated, we address
    the conservation of the genes involved in this network and the forces that
    have shaped its evolution during the divergence of angiosperms. We recovered
    the network gene homologs for 18 species of flowering plants spanning nine
    families. We found that all the genes are highly conserved with no evidence
    of positive selection. We studied the sequence conservation features of the
    genes in the context of their known biological function and the strength of
    the purifying selection acting upon them in relation to their placement
    within the network. Our results suggest an association between protein
    length and sequence conservation, evolutionary rates, and functional
    category. On the other hand, we found no significant correlation between the
    strength of purifying selection and gene placement. Our results confirm that
    the studied robust developmental regulatory module has been subjected to
    strong functional constraints. However, unlike previous studies, our results
    do not support the notion that network topology plays a major role in
    constraining evolutionary rates. We speculate that the dynamical functional
    role of genes within the network and not just its connectivity could play an
    important role in constraining evolution.

    ABSTRACT: Ageing is a challenge for any living organism and human longevity
    is a complex phenotype. With increasing life expectancy, maintaining
    long-term health, functionality and well-being during ageing has become an
    essential goal. To increase our understanding of how ageing works, it may be
    advantageous to analyze the phenotype of centenarians, perhaps one of the
    best examples of successful ageing. Healthy ageing involves the interaction
    between genes, the environment, and lifestyle factors, particularly diet.
    Besides evaluating specific gene-environment interactions in relation to
    exceptional longevity, it is important to focus attention on modifiable
    lifestyle factors such as diet and nutrition to achieve extension of health
    span. Furthermore, a better understanding of human longevity may assist in
    the design of strategies to extend the duration of optimal human health. In
    this article we briefly discuss relevant topics on ageing and longevity with
    particular focus on dietary patterns of centenarians and nutrient-sensing
    pathways that have a pivotal role in the regulation of life span. Finally,
    we also discuss the potential role of Nrf2 system in the pro-ageing
    signaling emphasizing its phytohormetic activation.

    Insect olfactory receptor (Or) genes are large, rapidly evolving gene
    families of considerable interest for evolutionary studies. They determine
    the responses of sensory neurons which mediate critical behaviours and
    ecological adaptations. We investigated the evolution across the genus
    Drosophila of a subfamily of Or genes largely responsible for the perception
    of ecologically relevant aliphatic esters; products of yeast fermentation
    and fruits. Odour responses were recorded from eight classes of olfactory
    receptor neurons known to express this Or subfamily in D. melanogaster and
    from homologous sensilla in seven other species. Despite the fact that these
    species have diverged over an estimated 40 million years, we find that odour
    specificity is largely maintained in seven of the eight species. In
    contrast, we observe extensive changes in most neurons of the outgroup
    species D. virilis, and in two neurons across the entire genus. Some neurons
    show small shifts in specificity, whilst some dramatic changes correlate
    with gene duplication or loss. An olfactory receptor neuron response
    similarity tree did not match an Or sequence similarity tree, but by
    aligning Or proteins of likely functional equivalence we identify residues
    that may be relevant for odour specificity. This will inform future
    structure-function studies of Drosophila Ors.

  abstract: >-
    Odor coding relies on the activity of different classes of receptor neurons,
    each with distinct response characteristics. We have examined odor coding in
    a model olfactory organ, the maxillary palp of Drosophila. This organ
    contains only 120 olfactory receptor neurons, compartmentalized in sensory
    hairs called sensilla, and provides an opportunity to characterize all
    neurons in an entire olfactory organ. Extensive extracellular recordings
    from single sensilla reveal that the neurons fall into six functional
    classes. Each of the 60 sensilla houses two neurons, which observe a pairing
    rule: each sensillum combines neurons of two particular classes, thereby
    yielding three sensillum types. The sensillum types are intermingled on the
    surface of the palp, but their distribution is not random. The neurons
    exhibit diverse response characteristics, providing the basis for an
    olfactory code. A particular odor can excite one neuron and inhibit another
    and a particular neuron can be excited by one odor and inhibited by another.
    Some excitatory responses continue beyond the end of odor delivery, but
    responses to most odors terminate abruptly after the end of odor delivery,
    with some followed by a period of poststimulus quiescence. The specificity
    of odor response is examined in detail for the neurons of one sensillum,
    which were found to differ in their relative responses to a homologous
    series of esters. Adaptation and cross-adaptation are documented, and
    cross-adaptation experiments demonstrate that the two neurons within one
    type of sensillum can function independently. The analysis of all neuronal
    types in this model olfactory organ is discussed in terms of its functional
    organization and the mechanisms by which it encodes olfactory information.

    Next generation sequencing technologies have found a widespread use in the
    study of host–microbe interactions due to the increase in their throughput
    and their ever-decreasing costs. The analysis of human-associated microbial
    communities using a marker gene, particularly the 16S rRNA, has greatly
    benefited from these technologies, the human gut microbiome research being a
    remarkable example of such analysis that has greatly expanded our
    understanding of microbe-mediated human health and disease, metabolism and
    food absorption. 16S studies go through a series of in vitro and in silico
    steps that can greatly influence their outcomes. However, the lack of a
    standardized workflow has led to uncertainties regarding the transparency
    and reproducibility of gut microbiome studies. We here discuss the most
    common challenges in the archetypical 16S rRNA workflow, including the
    extraction of total DNA, its use as template in PCR with primers that
    amplify specific hypervariable regions of the gene, amplicon sequencing, the
    denoising and removal of low quality reads, the detection and removal of
    chimeric sequences, the clustering of high-quality sequences into
    operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their taxonomic classification. We
    recommend the essential technical information that should be conveyed in
    publications for reproducibility of results and encourage non-experts to
    include procedures and available tools that mitigate most of the problems
    encountered in microbiome analysis.

    Next Generation Sequencing is having an extremely strong impact in

    from gene expression quantification to genotyping and genome reconstruction.
    Sequencing data is often provided as raw reads which are processed prior to
    analysis 1 of the most used preprocessing procedures is read trimming, which
    aims at removing low quality portions while preserving the longest high
    quality part of a NGS read. In the current work, we evaluate nine different
    trimming algorithms in four datasets and three common NGS-based applications
    (RNA-Seq, SNP calling and genome assembly). Trimming is shown to increase
    the quality and reliability of the analysis, with concurrent gains in terms
    of execution time and computational resources needed.

    Advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics have made the
    analysis of microbial communities almost routine. Nonetheless, the need
    remains to improve on the techniques used for gathering such data, including
    increasing throughput while lowering cost and benchmarking the techniques so
    that potential sources of bias can be better characterized.

    Reciprocal selection between aphids, their protective endosymbionts, and the
    parasitoid wasps that prey upon them offers an opportunity to study the
    basis of their coevolution. We investigated adaptation to symbiont-conferred
    defense by rearing the parasitoid wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum on aphids (Aphis
    fabae) possessing different defensive symbiont strains (Hamiltonella
    defensa). After ten generations of experimental evolution, wasps showed
    increased abilities to parasitize aphids possessing the H. defensa strain
    they evolved with, but not aphids possessing the other strain. We show that
    the two symbiont strains encode different toxins, potentially creating
    different targets for counter-adaptation. Phenotypic and behavioral
    comparisons suggest that neither life-history traits nor oviposition
    behavior differed among evolved parasitoid lineages. In contrast,
    comparative transcriptomics of adult female wasps identified a suite of
    differentially expressed genes among lineages, even when reared in a common,
    symbiont-free, aphid host. In concurrence with the specificity of each
    parasitoid lineages’ infectivity, most differentially expressed parasitoid
    transcripts were also lineage-specific. These transcripts are enriched with
    putative venom toxins and contain highly expressed, potentially defensive
    viral particles. Together, these results suggest that wild populations of L.
    fabarum employ a complicated offensive arsenal with sufficient genetic
    variation for wasps to adapt rapidly and specifically to their hosts’
    microbial defenses.

    OCL1 (OUTER CELL LAYER1) encodes a maize HD-ZIP class IV transcription
    factor (TF) characterized by the presence of a homeo DNA-binding domain
    (HD), a dimerization leucine zipper domain (ZIP), and a steroidogenic acute
    regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer domain (START) involved in
    lipid transport in animals but the function of which is still unknown in
    plants. By combining yeast and plant trans-activation assays, the
    transcriptional activation domain of OCL1 was localized to 85 amino acids in
    the N-terminal part of the START domain. Full-length OCL1 devoid of this
    activation domain is unable to trans-activate a reporter gene under the
    control of a minimal promoter fused to six repeats of the L1 box, a
    cis-element present in target genes of HD-ZIP IV TFs in Arabidopsis. In
    addition, ectopic expression of OCL1 leads to pleiotropic phenotypic
    aberrations in transgenic maize plants, the most conspicuous one being a
    strong delay in flowering time which is correlated with the misexpression of
    molecular markers for floral transition such as ZMM4 (Zea Mays MADS-box4) or
    DLF1 (DELAYED FLOWERING1). As suggested by the interaction in planta between
    OCL1 and SWI3C1, a bona fide subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, OCL1 may
    modulate transcriptional activity of its target genes by interaction with a
    chromatin remodelling complex.

    About a 100 years ago, the Drosophila white mutant marked the birth of
    Drosophila genetics. The white gene turned out to encode the first well
    studied ABC transporter in arthropods. The ABC gene family is now recognized
    as one of the largest transporter families in all kingdoms of life. The
    majority of ABC proteins function as primary-active transporters that bind
    and hydrolyze ATP while transporting a large diversity of substrates across
    lipid membranes. Although extremely well studied in vertebrates for their
    role in drug resistance, less is known about the role of this family in the
    transport of endogenous and exogenous substances in arthropods. The ABC
    families of five insect species, a crustacean and a chelicerate have been
    annotated in some detail. We conducted a thorough phylogenetic analysis of
    the seven arthropod and human ABC protein subfamilies, to infer orthologous
    relationships that might suggest conserved function. Most orthologous
    relationships were found in the ABCB half transporter, ABCD, ABCE and ABCF
    subfamilies, but specific expansions within species and lineages are
    frequently observed and discussed. We next surveyed the role of ABC
    transporters in the transport of xenobiotics/plant allelochemicals and their
    involvement in insecticide resistance. The involvement of ABC transporters
    in xenobiotic resistance in arthropods is historically not well documented,
    but an increasing number of studies using unbiased differential gene
    expression analysis now points to their importance. We give an overview of
    methods that can be used to link ABC transporters to resistance. ABC
    proteins have also recently been implicated in the mode of action and
    resistance to Bt toxins in Lepidoptera. Given the enormous interest in Bt
    toxicology in transgenic crops, such findings will provide an impetus to
    further reveal the role of ABC transporters in arthropods.

    Network inference, which is the reconstruction of biological networks from
    high-throughput data, can provide valuable information about the regulation
    of gene expression in cells. However, it is an underdetermined problem, as
    the number of interactions that can be inferred exceeds the number of
    independent measurements. Different state-of-the-art tools for network
    inference use specific assumptions and simplifications to deal with
    underdetermination, and these influence the inferences. The outcome of
    network inference therefore varies between tools and can be highly
    complementary. Here we categorize the available tools according to the
    strategies that they use to deal with the problem of underdetermination.
    Such categorization allows an insight into why a certain tool is more
    appropriate for the specific research question or data set at hand.

    We developed a method for measuring ethoxycownarin deethylase (ECOD)
    activity using a single Drosophila abdomen. The activities obtained were
    well correlated with the classic method from microsomes (r = 0.902). This
    new method, performed in microtitration plates, was at least six times more
    sensitive compared to the conventional cuvet fluorometric one. Moreover, it
    was possible among a large number of insects to differentiate those with low
    or high ECOD activities. This improved procedure has been checked upon
    crosses between resistant strain (with high ECOD activity) and susceptible
    strain (with low ECOD activity), The results demonstrate the possible
    separation of resistant phenotypes and emphasize the importance of this
    approach in assessing the spreading of insecticide resistance in natural
    populations of insects. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

    Interspecific hybridization or barriers to hybridization may have
    contributed to the diversification of Antarctic icefishes (Channichthyidae),
    but data supporting these hypotheses is scarce. To understand the potential
    for hybridization and to investigate reproductive isolating mechanisms among
    icefish species, we performed in vitro fertilization experiments using eggs
    from a female blackfin icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus and sperm from a male
    of another genera, the ocellated icefish Chionodraco rastrospinosus.
    Sequencing of genomic and mitochondrial DNA confirmed the intergeneric
    hybrid nature of resulting embryos which successfully developed and hatched
    as active larvae at about four and a half months during the Antarctic
    winter. This result demonstrates the compatibility of gametes of these two
    species and the viability of resulting zygotes and larvae. Due to logistic
    constraints and the slow developmental rate of icefishes, we could not test
    for long-term hybrid viability, fertility, fitness, or hybrid breakdown.
    Analysis of our fishing records and available literature, however, suggests
    that the strongest barriers to hybridization among parapatric icefish
    species are likely to be behavioral and characterized by assortative mating
    and species-specific courtship and nesting behaviors. This conclusion
    suggests that, in long-lived fish species with late sexual maturity and high
    energetic investment in reproduction like icefishes, pre-mating barriers are
    energetically more efficient than post-mating barriers to prevent
    hybridization.

    Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful animal model to study the processes
    underlying behavioural responses to chemical cues. This paper provides a
    review of the important literature to present recent advances in our
    understanding of how gustatory and olfactory stimuli are perceived. An
    overview is given of the experimental procedures currently used to
    characterize the fly chemosensory behaviour. Since this species provides
    extremely useful genetic tools, a focus is made on those allowing to
    manipulate behaviour, and hence to understand its molecular and cellular
    bases. Such tools include single-gene mutants and the Gal4/UAS system. They
    can be combined with studies of the natural polymorphism of behavioural
    responses. Recent data obtained with these various approaches unravel some
    important aspects of taste and olfaction. These appear as rather complex
    processes, as revealed by results showing dose-dependence, plasticity and
    sexual dimorphism. Taken together, these results and the available tools
    open interesting perspectives for the years to come, in our attempts to make
    the link between genes and behaviour. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

    Resistance to organophosphorus (OP) insecticides in Lucilia cuprina arises
    from two mutations in carboxylesteraseE3 that enable it to hydrolyse the
    phosphate ester of various organophosphates, plus the carboxlyester in the
    leaving group in the case of malathion. These mutations are not found
    naturally in the orthologous EST23 enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster. We
    have introduced the two mutations (G137D and W251L) into cloned genes
    encoding E3 and EST23 from susceptible L. cuprina and D. melanogaster and
    expressed them in vitro with the baculovirus system. The ability of the
    resultant enzymes to hydrolyse the phosphate ester of diethyl and dimethyl
    organophosphates was studied by a novel fluorometric assay, which also
    provided a sensitive titration technique for the molar amount of esterase
    regardless of its ability to hydrolyse the fluorogenic substrate used.
    Malathion carboxylesterase activity was also measured. The G137D mutation
    markedly enhanced (>30-fold) hydrolysis of both classes of phosphate ester
    by E3 but only had a similar effect on the hydrolysis of dimethyl
    organophosphate in EST23. Introduction of the W251L mutation into either
    gene enhanced dimethyl (23-30-fold) more than diethyl (6-10-fold)
    organophosphate hydrolysis and slightly improved (2-4-fold) malathion
    carboxylesterase activity, but only at high substrate concentration. (C)

    Aggressive behavior is pervasive throughout the animal kingdom, and yet very
    little is known about its molecular underpinnings. To address this problem,
    we have developed a population-based selection procedure to increase
    aggression in Drosophila melanogaster. We measured changes in aggressive
    behavior in the selected subpopulations with a new two-male arena assay. In
    only ten generations of selection, the aggressive lines became markedly more
    aggressive than the neutral lines. After 21 generations, the fighting index
    increased more than 30-fold. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes
    with differing expression levels in the aggressive and neutral lines as
    candidates for this strong behavioral selection response. We tested a small
    set of these genes through mutant analysis and found that one significantly
    increased fighting frequency. These results suggest that selection for
    increases in aggression can be used to molecularly dissect this behavior.

  abstract: >-
    New evidence suggests a role for the plant growth hormone auxin in
    pathogenesis and disease resistance. Bacterial infection induces the
    accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the major type of auxin, in rice
    (Oryza sativa). IAA induces the expression of expansins, proteins that
    loosen the cell wall. Loosening the cell wall is key for plant growth but
    may also make the plant vulnerable to biotic intruders. Here, we report that
    rice GH3-8, an auxin-responsive gene functioning in auxin-dependent
    development, activates disease resistance in a salicylic acid signaling- and
    jasmonic acid signaling-independent pathway. GH3-8 encodes an IAA-amino
    synthetase that prevents free IAA accumulation. Overexpression of GH3-8
    results in enhanced disease resistance to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas
    oryzae pv oryzae. This resistance is independent of jasmonic acid and
    salicylic acid signaling. Overexpression of GH3-8 also causes abnormal plant
    morphology and retarded growth and development. Both enhanced resistance and
    abnormal development may be caused by inhibition of the expression of
    expansins via suppressed auxin signaling.

  abstract: "Imidacloprid is a key insecticide extensively used for control of Nilaparvata lugens, and its resistance had been reported both in the laboratory selected strains and field populations. A target site mutation Y151S in two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits and enhanced oxidative detoxification have been identified in the laboratory resistant strain, contributing importantly to imidacloprid resistance in N.\_lugens. To date, however, imidacloprid resistance in field population is primarily attributable to enhanced oxidative detoxification by over-expressed P450 monooxygenases. A resistant strain (Res), originally collected from a field population and continuously selected in laboratory with imidacloprid for more than 40 generations, had 180.8-fold resistance to imidacloprid, compared to a susceptible strain (Sus). Expression of different putative P450 genes at mRNA levels was detected and compared between Res and Sus strains, and six genes were found expressed significantly higher in Res strain than in Sus strain. CYP6AY1 was found to be the most different expressed P450 gene and its mRNA level in Res strain was 17.9 times of that in Sus strain. By expressing in E.\_coli cells, CYP6AY1 was found to metabolize imidacloprid efficiently with initial velocity calculated of 0.851\_±\_0.073\_pmol/min/pmol P450. When CYP6AY1 mRNA levels in Res strain was reduced by RNA interference, imidacloprid susceptibility was recovered. In four field populations with different resistance levels, high levels of CYP6AY1 transcript were also found. In\_vitro and in\_vivo studies provided evidences that the over-expression of CYP6AY1 was one of the key factors contributing to imidacloprid resistance in the laboratory selected strain Res, which might also be the important mechanism for imidacloprid resistance in field populations, when the target site mutation was not prevalent at present."

    Although single-cell transcriptome data are increasingly available, their
    interpretation remains a challenge. Here, the authors present a
    dimensionality reduction approach that preserves both the local and global
    neighbourhood structures in the data thus enhancing its interpretability.

    Ion transport peptides (ITPs) belong to a large arthropod neuropeptide
    family including crustacean hyperglycaemic hormones and are antidiuretic
    hormones in locusts. Because long and short ITP isoforms are generated by
    alternative splicing from a single gene in locusts and moths, we
    investigated whether similarly spliced gene products occur in the nervous
    system of Drosophila melanogaster throughout postembryogenesis. The itp gene
    CG13586 was reanalyzed, and we found three instead of the two previously
    annotated alternatively spliced mRNAs. These give rise to three different
    neuropeptides, two long C-terminally carboxylated isoforms (DrmITPL1 and
    DrmITPL2, both 87 amino acids) and one short amidated DrmITP (73 amino
    acids), which were partially identified biochemically. Immunocytochemistry
    and in situ hybridization reveal nine larval and 14 adult identified
    neurons: four pars lateralis neurosecretory neurons, three
    hindgut-innervating neurons in abdominal ganglia, and a stage-specific
    number of interneurons and peripheral bipolar neurons. The neurosecretory
    neurons persist throughout postembryogenesis, form release sites in corpora
    cardiaca, and invade corpora allata. One type of ITP-expressing interneuron
    exists only in the larval and prepupal subesophageal ganglia, whereas three
    types of interneurons in the adult brain arise in late pupae and invade
    circumscribed neuropils in superior median and lateral brain areas. One
    peripheral bipolar and putative sensory neuron type occurs in the larval,
    pupal, and adult preterminal abdominal segments. Although the neurosecretory
    neurons may release DrmITP and DrmITPL2 into the haemolymph, possible
    physiological roles of the hindgut-innervating and peripheral neurons as
    well as the interneurons are yet to be identified.

    Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are
    found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A
    complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their
    characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because
    RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by
    genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are
    focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and
    translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding
    genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human
    genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the
    range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory
    regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of
    previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a
    redefinition of the concept of a gene.

    Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is becoming an attractive alternative to
    array-based methods for genotyping individuals for a large number of single
    nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Costs can be lowered by reducing the mean
    sequencing depth, but this results in genotype calls of lower quality. A
    common analysis strategy is to filter SNPs to just those with sufficient
    depth, thereby greatly reducing the number of SNPs available. We investigate
    methods for estimating relatedness using GBS data, including results of low
    depth, using theoretical calculation, simulation and application to a real
    data set.

    Ten thousand years ago human societies around the globe began to transition
    from hunting and gathering to agriculture. By 4000 years ago, ancient
    peoples had completed the domestication of all major crop species upon which
    human survival is dependent, including rice, wheat, and maize. Recent
    research has begun to reveal the genes responsible for this agricultural
    revolution. The list of genes to date tentatively suggests that diverse
    plant developmental pathways were the targets of Neolithic "genetic
    tinkering," and we are now closer to understanding how plant development was
    redirected to meet the needs of a hungry world.

    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs found in organisms as
    evolutionarily distant as plants and mammals, yet most of the mRNAs they
    regulate are unknown. Here we show that the ability of an miRNA to
    translationally repress a target mRNA is largely dictated by the free energy
    of binding of the first eight nucleotides in the 5' region of the miRNA.
    However, G:U wobble base-pairing in this region interferes with activity
    beyond that predicted on the basis of thermodynamic stability. Furthermore,
    an mRNA can be simultaneously repressed by more than one miRNA species. The
    level of repression achieved is dependent on both the amount of mRNA and the
    amount of available miRNA complexes. Thus, predicted miRNA:mRNA interactions
    must be viewed in the context of other potential interactions and cellular
    conditions.

    Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid production of large sequence
    data sets. These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and
    biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read
    output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short
    read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic
    clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We
    found that error rates range from 0.3% at the beginning of reads to 3.8% at
    the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base
    substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A > C
    transversion being among the most frequent and C > G transversions among the
    least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases
    occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold
    sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads.
    The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read
    density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality
    scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality.
    Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such
    biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for
    de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide
    polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome
    analysis.

  abstract: >-
    Two evolutionarily distant plant species, rice (Oryza sativa L.), a
    short-day (SD) plant, and Arabidopsis thaliana, a long-day plant, share a
    conserved genetic network controlling photoperiodic flowering. The
    orthologous floral regulators-rice Heading date 1 (Hd1) and Arabidopsis
    CONSTANS (CO)-integrate circadian clock and external light signals into mRNA
    expression of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) group floral inducer. Here, we
    report that the rice Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene, which confers SD
    promotion of flowering in the absence of a functional allele of Hd1, encodes
    a B-type response regulator that might not have an ortholog in the
    Arabidopsis genome. Ehd1 mRNA was induced by 1-wk SD treatment, and Ehd1 may
    promote flowering by inducing FT-like gene expression only under SD
    conditions. Microarray analysis further revealed a few MADS box genes
    downstream of Ehd1. Our results indicate that a novel two-component
    signaling cascade is integrated into the conserved pathway in the
    photoperiodic control of flowering in rice.

    Over the past decade, site-directed mutagenesis has become an essential tool
    in the study of mammalian cytochrome P450 structure-function relationships.
    Residues affecting substrate specificity, cooperativity, membrane
    localization, and interactions with redox partners have been identified
    using a combination of amino-acid sequence alignments, homology modeling,
    chimeragenesis, and site-directed mutagenesis. As homology modeling and
    substrate docking technology continue to improve, the ability tv predict
    more precise functions For specific residues will also advance, making it
    possible to utilize site-directed mutagenesis to test these predictions.
    Future studies will employ site-directed mutagenesis to learn more about
    cytochrome P450 substrate access channels, to define the role of residues
    that do not lie within substrate recognition sites, to engineer additional
    soluble forms of microsomal cytochromes P450 for x-ray crystallography, and
    to engineer more efficient enzymes for drug activation and/or
    bioremediation.

    RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful technology to characterize
    gene expression profiles because it is more accurate and comprehensive than
    microarrays. Although statistical methods that have been developed for
    microarray data can be applied to RNA-Seq data, they are not ideal due to
    the discrete nature of RNA-Seq data. The Poisson distribution and negative
    binomial distribution are commonly used to model count data. Recently,
    Witten (Annals Appl Stat 5:2493–2518, 2011) proposed a Poisson linear
    discriminant analysis for RNA-Seq data. The Poisson assumption may not be as
    appropriate as the negative binomial distribution when biological replicates
    are available and in the presence of overdispersion (i.e., when the variance
    is larger than or equal to the mean). However, it is more complicated to
    model negative binomial variables because they involve a dispersion
    parameter that needs to be estimated.

    Thomas Hunt Morgan and colleagues identified variation in gene copy number
    in Drosophila in the 1920s and 1930s and linked such variation to phenotypic
    differences [Bridges CB (1936) Science 83:210]. Yet the extent of variation
    in the number of chromosomes, chromosomal regions, or gene copies, and the
    importance of this variation within species, remain poorly understood. Here,
    we focus on copy-number variation in Drosophila melanogaster. We
    characterize copy-number polymorphism (CNP) across genomic regions, and we
    contrast patterns to infer the evolutionary processes acting on this
    variation. Copy-number variation in D. melanogaster is nonrandomly
    distributed, presumably because of a mutational bias produced by tandem
    repeats or other mechanisms. Comparisons of coding and noncoding CNPs,
    however, reveal a strong effect of purifying selection in the removal of
    structural variation from functionally constrained regions. Most patterns of
    CNP in D. melanogaster suggest that negative selection and mutational biases
    are the primary agents responsible for shaping structural variation.

  abstract: >-
    Good osmoregulation is critical to the success of insects, and the
    Malpighian tubules play a key role in osmoregulation. Recently, the
    application of genetics and genomics to the Drosophila tubule has revealed
    far more extensive roles than ion and water transport. Microarray analysis
    shows that organic solute transporters dominate the tubule transcriptome.
    The tubule thus has the capability to excrete actively the broadest range of
    organic solutes and xenobiotics. Such transporters can produce unexpected,
    emergent roles for the whole tissue; e.g. the tubule is highly resistant to
    ouabain not because the Na+, K+ ATPase is unimportant, but because it
    co-localises with a potent alkaloid excretory mechanism. Reinforcing this
    role in excretion, the tubule expresses very high levels of a particular
    cytochrome P450 s, glutathione-S-transferases and alchohol dehydrogenases
    which suggest that the tubule plays a major role in metabolism and
    detoxification of both endogenous solutes and xenobiotics, such as
    insecticides. Additionally, the tubule plays a significant role in immunity;
    tubules are capable of sensing bacterial challenge, and mounting an
    effective killing response by secretion of antimicrobial peptides, entirely
    independent of the fat body, the canonical immune tissue. The tubule has
    also proved to be a good model for some human renal disease, and to act as
    an organotypic 'testbed' for mammalian genes. The tubule can thus bask in a
    greatly enhanced reputation as a key tissue for an unexpectedly wide range
    of functions in the insect. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: >-
    Genes that control ovule identity were first identified in Petunia.
    Co-suppression of both FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 7 (FBP7) and FBP11, two
    D-lineage genes, resulted in the homeotic transformation of ovules into
    carpelloid structures. Later in Arabidopsis it was shown that three genes,
    SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1), SHP2, and SEEDSTICK (STK), redundantly control ovule
    identity, because in the stk shp1 shp2 triple mutant ovules lose identity
    and are transformed into carpel and leaf-like structures. Of these three
    Arabidopsis genes STK is the only D-lineage gene, and its expression, like
    FBP7 and FBP11, is restricted to ovules. OsMADS13 is the rice ortholog of
    STK, FBP7, and FBP11. Its amino acid sequence is similar to the Arabidopsis
    and Petunia proteins, and its expression is also restricted to ovules. We
    show that the osmads13 mutant is female sterile and that ovules are
    converted into carpelloid structures. Furthermore, making carpels inside
    carpels, the osmads13 flower is indeterminate, showing that OsMADS13 also
    has a function in floral meristem determinacy. OsMADS21 is most likely to be
    a paralog of OsMADS13, although its expression is not restricted to ovules.
    Interestingly, the osmads21 mutant did not show any obvious phenotype.
    Furthermore, combining the osmads13 and the osmads21 mutants did not result
    in any additive ovule defect, indicating that osmads21 does not control
    ovule identity. These results suggest that during evolution the D-lineage
    gene OsMADS21 has lost its ability to determine ovule identity.

    Reproductive organ development is one of the most important steps in the
    life cycle of plants. Studies using core eudicot species like thale cress
    (Arabidopsis thaliana) and snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) have shown that
    MADS domain transcription factors belonging to the AGAMOUS (AG) subfamily
    regulate the identity of stamens, carpels, and ovules and that they are
    important for floral meristem determinacy. Here, we investigate the genetic
    interactions between the four rice (Oryza sativa) AG subfamily members,
    MADS3, MADS13, MADS21, and MADS58. Our data show that, in contrast with
    previous reports, MADS3 and MADS58 determine stamen and carpel identity and,
    together with MADS13, are important for floral meristem determinacy. In the
    mads3 mads58 double mutant, we observed a complete loss of reproductive
    organ identity and massive accumulation of lodicules in the third and fourth
    floral whorls. MADS21 is an AGL11 lineage gene whose expression is not
    restricted to ovules. Instead, its expression profile is similar to those of
    class C genes. However, our genetic analysis shows that MADS21 has no
    function in stamen, carpel, or ovule identity determination.

    We combined traditional quantitative genetics and oligonucleotide
    microarrays to examine within population genetic variation in a trait
    closely related to fitness. The trait, male reproductive success under
    competitive conditions (MCRS), is of central importance to both life-history
    and sexual-selection theory. We identified 27 candidate genes whose
    expression levels were associated with within-population variation in MCRS.
    'High' MCRS was associated with low expression of a cytochrome P450 that
    causes pesticide resistance, suggesting a fitness cost to resistance. Two
    groups of metabolic proteins (glutathione transferases and phosphatases)
    were significantly over-represented, and a large portion of the candidates
    are genes involved in oxidative stress resistance, energy acquisition or
    energy storage. Genes expressed in accessory glands and testes were not
    over-represented among differentially expressed genes, but testis-expressed
    genes were significantly more likely to be upregulated in high MCRS
    genotypes. Finally, nine candidate genes that we identified had no previous
    functional annotation, and this experiment suggests that they play a role in
    male reproductive success.

  abstract: >-
    AGL6-clade genes are a subfamily of MADS-box genes and preferentially
    expressed in floral organs. OsMADS6 and OsMADS17 are two AGL6-like genes in
    rice. OsMADS17 has been shown to play a minor role in floral development and
    appears to result from a duplication of OsMADS6. OsMADS6 was initially named
    as MFO1 for mosaic floral organs based on its moderate mutant phenotypes. So
    far, four moderate or weak mutant alleles of OsMADS6 have been described,
    providing valuable insights into its role in flower development. Here, we
    report a null allele of OsMADS6 (Osmads6-5), which exhibited a strong mutant
    phenotype in spikelet without affecting vegetative traits, causing all
    floral organs except lemma homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs
    (LLOs) as well as an indeterminate floral meristem, thus resulting in a
    mutant floret consisting of reiterating whorls of lemma and LLOs. In
    consistently, over-expression of OsMADS6 led to additional lodicule-,
    stamen- and carpel-like organs. Expression analysis showed that OsMADS6
    controls the formation of the incipient primordia of lodicule, stamen and
    carpel via regulating the expression of class B, C and SEP-like MADS-box
    genes. Taken together, our results revealed that OsMADS6 acts as a critical
    regulator for early flower development in rice and provide novel insights
    into the molecular mechanism of OsMADS6.

    Copper cells in the Drosophila larval midgut Were originally named for their
    ability to accumulate dietary copper. Recent studies have uncovered a number
    of intriguing similarities between copper cells and the acid-producing
    gastric parietal cells of the mammalian stomach. In addition to their shared
    roles in stomach acidification, they share a peculiar invaginated morphology
    in which the apical cell surface is buried deep within the cytoplasm. These
    shared properties of morphology and function portend the identification of
    shared molecular mechanisms that account for their specialized roles in
    digestive physiology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    Hi-C for mosquito genomes

    Most genomes sequenced today are determined through the generation of short
    sequenced bits of DNA that are computationally pieced together like a jigsaw
    puzzle. This has resulted in the need for funds and additional data to fill
    in gaps in order to fully assemble the many chromosomes that make up a
    eukaryotic genome. Dudchenko et al. used the Hi-C method, which measures the
    distance between contact points within and between chromosomes for scaffold
    validation, together with correction and ordering to more completely
    determine the arrangement of short sequencing reads for genome mapping. They
    validated their approach through the de novo generation of a complete human
    genome. A comparative analysis of mosquito genomes was made possible by
    improving the Culex quinquefasciatus genome assembly and generating the
    genome of Aedes aegypti, the vector of Zika virus.

    Science, this issue p. 92

    The Zika outbreak, spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, highlights the need
    to create high-quality assemblies of large genomes in a rapid and
    cost-effective way. Here we combine Hi-C data with existing draft assemblies
    to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. We validate this method by
    assembling a human genome, de novo, from short reads alone (67× coverage).
    We then combine our method with draft sequences to create genome assemblies
    of the mosquito disease vectors Ae. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, each
    consisting of three scaffolds corresponding to the three chromosomes in each
    species. These assemblies indicate that almost all genomic rearrangements
    among these species occur within, rather than between, chromosome arms. The
    genome assembly procedure we describe is fast, inexpensive, and accurate,
    and can be applied to many species.

    The DNA proximity ligation method Hi-C was used to create a genome assembly
    for the mosquito Aedes aegypti.

  abstract: >-
    The cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6a2 from Drosophila melanogaster is located on
    the right arm of chromosome 2 at position 43A1-2 and comprises two exons
    separated by a 69-bp intron. Phenobarbital treatment of flies leads to a
    rapid increase in the level of CYP6A2 mRNA and to an increased production of
    the CYP6A2 protein. DNA from the Cyp6a2 promoter region was functional when
    linked to a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into D. melanogaster
    Schneider cells. Moreover, a dose-dependent induction of luciferase activity
    by phenobarbital indicated that elements necessary for phenobarbital
    induction are located within 428 bp of the translation start site.
    Heterologous expression of the CYP6A2 protein in lepidopteran cells infected
    with a Cyp6a2-recombinant baculovirus was observed by Western blotting of
    cell lysates and by spectral characterization of the reduced-CO complex of
    the P450. The CYP6A2 protein produced in this system metabolized aldrin and
    heptachlor to their epoxides and metabolized the insecticide diazinon by
    desulfuration to diazoxon and by oxidative ester cleavage to
    2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine. Metabolism in lysates of cells
    infected with recombinant baculovirus was greatly enhanced by the addition
    of purified housefly NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5.
    These results show that CYP6A2 catalyzes the metabolism of organophosphorus
    insecticides and they implicate Cyp6a2 overexpression in metabolic
    resistance. The Cyp6a2 gene appears to be a suitable model for a genetic
    analysis of the phenobarbital induction process.

    Population genetics is a powerful tool for invasion biology and pest
    management, and useful for a range of questions from tracing invasion
    pathways to informing management decisions with inference of population
    demographics. Genomics greatly increases the resolution of population-scale
    analyses, yet outside of model species with extensive genomic resources, few
    studies have used population genomics in invasion biology. We use
    genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate population
    genomic structure with samples from across the range of melon fly,
    Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett, 1849), a highly polyphagous pest of
    commercial produce. We then make use of a chromosome-scale genome assembly
    and gene set to compare signatures of selection across the melon fly’s
    genome, both across our sampling as a whole and in the context of two
    independent, established introductions. Using multiple approaches, we find
    support for six genetic clusters across melon fly’s distribution. Some of
    these agree with previously identified genetic clusters using
    microsatellites, but consensus of clusters in mainland and oceanic southeast
    Asia is confounded by variable sampling between studies. We find few
    adaptive signatures across the genome, and virtually no unique signatures
    when comparing the two independent introductions, which suggests that
    similar management strategies are appropriate across melon fly’s range. This
    is the first use of genome-wide data to characterize population structure in
    tephritid fruit fly pests, and our SNP dataset provides a foundation for
    objective and cost-effective genotyping of previously collected melon fly
    specimens. Future research needs to focus on truly comprehensive sampling
    across melon fly’s range to overcome the historic variability of range-wide
    estimates of population structure for this pest.

    Genomic experiments produce multiple views of biological systems, among them
    are DNA sequence and copy number variation, and mRNA and protein abundance.
    Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public
    databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the
    relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can
    be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We
    demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and
    jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to
    provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are
    encountered in making gene-to-transcript-to-protein mappings. The approach
    provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for
    state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.

  abstract: "The recent association of Zika virus with cases of microcephaly has sparked a global health crisis and highlighted the need for mechanisms to combat the Zika vector, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia pipientis, a bacterial endosymbiont of insect, has recently garnered attention as a mechanism for arbovirus control. Here we report that Aedes aegypti harboring Wolbachia are highly resistant to infection with two currently circulating Zika virus isolates from the recent Brazilian epidemic. Wolbachia-harboring mosquitoes displayed lower viral prevalence and intensity and decreased disseminated infection and, critically, did not carry infectious virus in the saliva, suggesting that viral transmission was blocked. Our data\_indicate that the use of Wolbachia-harboring mosquitoes could represent an effective mechanism to reduce Zika virus transmission and should be included as part of Zika control strategies."

  abstract: >-
    Changes in host specialization contribute to the diversification of
    phytophagous insects. When shifting to anew host, insects evolve new
    physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations. Our understanding
    of the genetic changes responsible for these adaptations is limited. For
    instance, we do not know how often host shifts involve gain-of-function vs.
    loss-of-function alleles. Recent work suggests that some genes involved in
    odor recognition are lost in specialists. Here we show that genes involved
    in detoxification and metabolism, as well as those affecting olfaction, have
    reduced gene expression in Drosophila sechellia-a specialist on the fruit of
    Morinda citrifolia. We screened for genes that differ in expression between
    D. sechellia and its generalist sister species, D. simulans. We also
    screened for genes that are differentially expressed in D. sechellia when
    these flies chose their preferred host vs. when they were forced onto other
    food. D. sechellia increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and
    fatty acid metabolism when on its host. The majority of differentially
    expressed genes, however, appear downregulated in D. sechellia. For several
    functionally related genes, this decrease in expression is associated with
    apparent loss-of-function alleles. For example, the D. sechellia allele of
    Odorant. binding protein 56e (Obp56e) harbors a premature stop codon. We
    show that knockdown of Obp56e activity significantly reduces the avoidance
    response of D. melanogaster toward M. citrifolia. We argue that apparent
    loss-of-function alleles like Obp56e potentially contributed to the initial
    adaptation of D. sechellia to its host. Our results suggest that a subset of
    genes reduce or lose function as a consequence of host specialization, which
    may explain why, in general, specialist insects tend to shift to chemically
    similar hosts.

    The human genome contains “dark” gene regions that cannot be adequately
    assembled or aligned using standard short-read sequencing technologies,
    preventing researchers from identifying mutations within these gene regions
    that may be relevant to human disease. Here, we identify regions with few
    mappable reads that we call dark by depth, and others that have ambiguous
    alignment, called camouflaged. We assess how well long-read or linked-read
    technologies resolve these regions.

    Current genotyping approaches for single-nucleotide variations rely on
    short, accurate reads from second-generation sequencing devices. Presently,
    third-generation sequencing platforms are rapidly becoming more widespread,
    yet approaches for leveraging their long but error-prone reads for
    genotyping are lacking. Here, we introduce a novel statistical framework for
    the joint inference of haplotypes and genotypes from noisy long reads, which
    we term diplotyping. Our technique takes full advantage of linkage
    information provided by long reads. We validate hundreds of thousands of
    candidate variants that have not yet been included in the high-confidence
    reference set of the Genome-in-a-Bottle effort.

    Transitioning from trials to pest control tool, the efficacy of controlling
    wasps Vespula vulgaris and V. germanica using Vespex® wasp bait was tested
    in 2015. Vespex® is a protein-based bait matrix with 0.1% fipronil. Five
    sites ranging <300 to >2000 ha and over 5500 ha in total had bait stations
    placed 300 × 50 m apart and received one application of Vespex®. Wasp nest
    traffic rates declined 93% in four days at one site, and over 97% after
    20–38 days at all other sites. Measured honeydew availability also improved
    post wasp control. Further demonstrating feasibility, five different
    agencies worked closely with government leading many programme aspects.
    Vespex® was made more widely available in New Zealand towards the end of
    2015. Web page information showed ∼30% of all territorial authorities
    nationally are engaging in pest wasp problems. This signals a future
    potential in the way that pest wasps might be managed in a community context
    for social, economic and biodiversity conservation objectives.

    Low-cost whole-genome assembly has enabled the collection of
    haplotype-resolved pangenomes for numerous organisms. In turn, this
    technological change is encouraging the development of methods that can
    precisely address the sequence and variation described in large collections
    of related genomes. These approaches often use graphical models of the
    pangenome to support algorithms for sequence alignment, visualization,
    functional genomics, and association studies. The additional information
    provided to these methods by the pangenome allows them to achieve superior
    performance on a variety of bioinformatic tasks, including read alignment,
    variant calling, and genotyping. Pangenome graphs stand to become a
    ubiquitous tool in genomics. Although it is unclear whether they will
    replace linear reference genomes, their ability to harmoniously relate
    multiple sequence and coordinate systems will make them useful irrespective
    of which pangenomic models become most common in the future. Expected final
    online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human
    Genetics, Volume 21 is August 31, 2020. Please see

  abstract: >-
    Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA
    sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now
    feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a
    procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity
    with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely
    specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome
    that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using
    methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and
    lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This
    tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in
    species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is
    demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant
    inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were
    mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a
    complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed
    around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample
    genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the
    sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship
    analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply
    be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding,
    conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant
    breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species
    without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation
    biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the
    genome or diversity in the species.

    The first generation of genome sequence assemblies and annotations have had
    a significant impact upon our understanding of the biology of the sequenced
    species, the phylogenetic relationships among species, the study of
    populations within and across species, and have informed the biology of
    humans. As only a few Metazoan genomes are approaching finished quality
    (human, mouse, fly and worm), there is room for improvement of most genome
    assemblies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome, published in 2006, was
    noted for its bimodal GC content distribution that affected the quality of
    the assembly in some regions and for fewer genes in the initial gene set
    (OGSv1.0) compared to what would be expected based on other sequenced insect
    genomes.

    BACKGROUND:Shoots of all land plants have a radial pattern that can be
    considered to have an adaxial (central)-abaxial (peripheral) polarity. In
    Arabidopsis, gain-of-function alleles of PHAVOLUTA and PHABULOSA, members of
    the class III HD-ZIP gene family, result in adaxialization of lateral
    organs. Conversely, loss-of-function alleles of the KANADI genes cause an
    adaxialization of lateral organs. Thus, the class III HD-ZIP and KANADI
    genes comprise a genetic system that patterns abaxial-adaxial polarity in
    lateral organs produced from the apical meristem. RESULTS:We show that
    gain-of-function alleles of REVOLUTA, another member of the class III HD-ZIP
    gene family, are characterized by adaxialized lateral organs and alterations
    in the radial patterning of vascular bundles in the stem. The
    gain-of-function phenotype can be obtained by changing only the REVOLUTA
    mRNA sequence and without changing the protein sequence; this finding
    indicates that this phenotype is likely mediated through an interference
    with microRNA binding. Loss of KANADI activity results in similar
    alterations in vascular patterning as compared to REVOLUTA gain-of-function
    alleles. Simultaneous loss-of-function of PHABULOSA, PHAVOLUTA, and REVOLUTA
    abaxializes cotyledons, abolishes the formation of the primary apical
    meristem, and in severe cases, eliminates bilateral symmetry; these
    phenotypes implicate these three genes in radial patterning of both
    embryonic and postembryonic growth. CONCLUSIONS:Based on complementary
    vascular and leaf phenotypes of class III HD-ZIP and KANADI mutants, we
    propose that a common genetic program dependent upon miRNAs governs
    adaxial-abaxial patterning of leaves and radial patterning of stems in the
    angiosperm shoot. This finding implies that a common patterning mechanism is
    shared between apical and vascular meristems.

    Many male animals wield ornaments or weapons of exaggerated proportions. We
    propose that increased cellular sensitivity to signaling through the
    insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway may be responsible for the
    extreme growth of these structures. We document how rhinoceros beetle horns,
    a sexually selected weapon, are more sensitive to nutrition and more
    responsive to perturbation of the insulin/IGF pathway than other body
    structures. We then illustrate how enhanced sensitivity to insulin/IGF
    signaling in a growing ornament or weapon would cause heightened condition
    sensitivity and increased variability in expression among
    individuals—critical properties of reliable signals of male quality. The
    possibility that reliable signaling arises as a by-product of the growth
    mechanism may explain why trait exaggeration has evolved so many different
    times in the context of sexual selection.

    Rhinoceros beetle horns, a sexually selected weapon, are more sensitive to
    nutrition and reliably indicate male quality.

    Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are a diverse family of enzymes found
    ubiquitously in aerobic organisms. They play a central role in the
    detoxification of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds and are also
    involved in intracellular transport, biosynthesis of hormones and protection
    against oxidative stress. Interest in insect GSTs has primarily focused on
    their role in insecticide resistance. GSTs can metabolize insecticides by
    facilitating their reductive dehydrochlorination or by conjugation reactions
    with reduced glutathione, to produce water-soluble metabolites that are more
    readily excreted. In addition, they contribute to the removal of toxic
    oxygen free radical species produced through the action of pesticides.
    Annotation of the Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster genomes has
    revealed the full extent of this enzyme family in insects. This mini review
    describes the insect GST enzyme family, focusing specifically on their role
    in conferring insecticide resistance.

    Although flowering time is often associated with plant size, little is known
    about how flowering time genes affect plant architecture. We grew four rice
    lines having different flowering time genotypes (hd1 ehd1, hd1 Ehd1, Hd1
    ehd1 and Hd1 Ehd1) under distinct photoperiod conditions. By using
    genotype-treatment combinations that resulted in similar flowering times, we
    were able to compare the effects of flowering time genes on traits related
    to plant architecture. The results revealed that the combination of
    Heading-date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) can reduce the number
    of primary branches in a panicle, resulting in smaller spikelet numbers per
    panicle; this occurs independently of the control of flowering time. In
    addition, expression of the Hd3a and Rice Flowering-locus T 1 (RFT1)
    florigen genes was up-regulated in leaves of the Hd1 Ehd1 line at the time
    of the floral transition. We further revealed that Hd1 and/or Ehd1 caused
    up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of
    panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle
    development. Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and Ehd1, can
    control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the
    field through florigen expression in leaf.

    Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons for microbial community profiling
    can, for equivalent costs, yield more than two orders of magnitude more
    sensitivity than traditional PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing. With this
    increased sensitivity and the ability to analyze multiple samples in
    parallel, it has become possible to evaluate several technical aspects of
    PCR-based community structure profiling methods. We tested the effect of
    amplicon length and primer pair on estimates of species richness (number of
    species) and evenness (relative abundance of species) by assessing the
    potentially tractable microbial community residing in the termite hindgut.
    Two regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced from one of two common
    priming sites, spanning the V1–V2 or V8 regions, using amplicons ranging in
    length from 352 to 1443 bp. Our results show that both amplicon length and
    primer pair markedly influence estimates of richness and evenness. However,
    estimates of species evenness are consistent among different primer pairs
    targeting the same region. These results highlight the importance of
    experimental methodology when comparing diversity estimates across
    communities.

    High-throughput RNA sequencing is an increasingly accessible method for
    studying gene structure and activity on a genome-wide scale. A critical step
    in RNA-seq data analysis is the alignment of partial transcript reads to a
    reference genome sequence. To assess the performance of current mapping
    software, we invited developers of RNA-seq aligners to process four large
    human and mouse RNA-seq data sets. In total, we compared 26 mapping
    protocols based on 11 programs and pipelines and found major performance
    differences between methods on numerous benchmarks, including alignment
    yield, basewise accuracy, mismatch and gap placement, exon junction
    discovery and suitability of alignments for transcript reconstruction. We
    observed concordant results on real and simulated RNA-seq data, confirming
    the relevance of the metrics employed. Future developments in RNA-seq
    alignment methods would benefit from improved placement of multimapped
    reads, balanced utilization of existing gene annotation and a reduced false
    discovery rate for splice junctions.

    Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and progressive
    neurodegenerative disorder with identified genetic causes representing a
    significant minority of all cases. A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion
    (HRE) mutation within the C9ORF72 gene has recently been identified as the
    most frequent known cause of ALS. The expansion leads to partial
    heterochromatinization of the locus, yet mutant RNAs and dipeptide repeat
    proteins (DPRs) are still produced in sufficient quantities to confer
    neurotoxicity. The levels of these toxic HRE products positively correlate
    with cellular toxicity and phenotypic severity across multiple disease
    models. Moreover, the degree of epigenetic repression inversely correlates
    with some facets of clinical presentation in C9-ALS patients. Recently,
    bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) have been used to generate transgenic
    mice that harbor the HRE mutation, complementing other relevant model
    systems such as patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
    While epigenetic features of the HRE have been investigated in various model
    systems and post-mortem tissues, epigenetic dysregulation at the expanded
    locus in C9-BAC mice remains unexplored.

    Flowers are icons in developmental studies of complex structures. The vast
    majority of 250,000 angiosperm plant species have flowers with a conserved
    organ plan bearing sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels in the center. The
    combinatorial model for the activity of the so-called ABC homeotic floral
    genes has guided extensive experimental studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and
    many other plant species. However, a mechanistic and dynamical explanation
    for the ABC model and prevalence among flowering plants is lacking. Here, we
    put forward a simple discrete model that postulates logical rules that
    formally summarize published ABC and non-ABC gene interaction data for
    Arabidopsis floral organ cell fate determination and integrates this data
    into a dynamic network model. This model shows that all possible initial
    conditions converge to few steady gene activity states that match gene
    expression profiles observed experimentally in primordial floral organ cells
    of wild-type and mutant plants. Therefore, the network proposed here
    provides a dynamical explanation for the ABC model and shows that precise
    signaling pathways are not required to restrain cell types to those found in
    Arabidopsis, but these are rather determined by the overall gene network
    dynamics. Furthermore, we performed robustness analyses that clearly show
    that the cell types recovered depend on the network architecture rather than
    on specific values of the model's gene interaction parameters. These results
    support the hypothesis that such a network constitutes a developmental
    module, and hence provide a possible explanation for the overall
    conservation of the ABC model and overall floral plan among angiosperms. In
    addition, we have been able to predict the effects of differences in network
    architecture between Arabidopsis and Petunia hybrida.

    The biology and health of the honey bee Apis mellifera has been of interest
    to human societies for centuries. Research on honey bee health is surging,
    in part due to new tools and the arrival of colony-collapse disorder (CCD),
    an unsolved decline in bees from parts of the United States, Europe, and
    Asia. Although a clear understanding of what causes CCD has yet to emerge,
    these efforts have led to new microbial discoveries and avenues to improve
    our understanding of bees and the challenges they face. Here we review the
    known honey bee microbes and highlight areas of both active and lagging
    research. Detailed studies of honey bee–pathogen dynamics will help efforts
    to keep this important pollinator healthy and will give general insights
    into both beneficial and harmful microbes confronting insect colonies.

    We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a
    single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into
    an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances
    among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
    produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs,
    designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic
    diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is
    flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices,
    corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different
    types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of
    the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics
    is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality
    assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate
    for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA
    haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when
    some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into
    the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional
    information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among
    haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into
    nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population
    genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not
    fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components.
    The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and
    it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical
    analysis of molecular data.

  abstract: >-
    We introduce a flexible and robust simulation-based framework to infer
    demographic parameters from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) computed on
    large genomic datasets. We show that our composite-likelihood approach
    allows one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which
    cannot be tackled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple
    scenarios, our approach compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed
    with , the current reference in the field, while showing better convergence
    properties for complex models. We first apply our methodology to non-coding
    genomic SNP data from four human populations. To infer their demographic
    history, we compare neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity,
    including unsampled populations. We further show the versatility of our
    framework by extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from
    SNP chips with known ascertainment, such as that recently released by
    Affymetrix to study human origins. Whereas previous ways of handling
    ascertained SNPs were either restricted to a single population or only
    allowed the inference of divergence time between a pair of populations, our
    framework can correctly infer parameters of more complex models including
    the divergence of several populations, bottlenecks and migration. We apply
    this approach to the reconstruction of African demography using two distinct
    ascertained human SNP panels studied under two evolutionary models. The two
    SNP panels lead to globally very similar estimates and confidence intervals,
    and suggest an ancient divergence (>110 Ky) between Yoruba and San
    populations. Our methodology appears well suited to the study of complex
    scenarios from large genomic data sets.

    To take advantage of affordable high-throughput next-generation sequencing
    technologies to characterize microbial community composition often requires
    the development of improved methods to overcome technical limitations
    inherent to the sequencing platforms. Sequencing low sequence diversity
    libraries such as 16S rRNA amplicons has been problematic on the Illumina
    MiSeq platform and often generates sequences of suboptimal quality.

  abstract: >-
    Drosophila affinidisjuncta and Drosophila hawaiiensis are closely related
    species that display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns for their
    homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Adh genes). In Drosophila
    melanogaster transformants, both genes are expressed at high levels in the
    larval and adult fat bodies, but the D. affinidisjuncta gene is expressed
    10-50-fold more strongly in the larval and adult midguts and Malpighian
    tubules. The present study reports the mapping of cis-acting sequences
    contributing to the regulatory differences between these two genes in
    transformants. Chimeric genes were constructed and introduced into the germ
    line of D. melanogaster. Stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns were
    determined by measuring steady-state RNA levels in larvae and adults. Three
    portions of the promoter region make distinct contributions to the
    tissue-specific regulatory differences between the native genes. Sequences
    immediately upstream of the distal promoter have a strong effect in the
    adult Malpighian tubules, while sequences between the two promoters are
    relatively important in the larval Malpighian tubules. A third gene segment,
    immediately upstream of the proximal promoter, influences levels of the
    proximal Adh transcript in all tissues and developmental stages examined,
    and largely accounts for the regulatory difference in the larval and adult
    midguts. However, these as well as other sequences make smaller
    contributions to various aspects of the tissue-specific regulatory
    differences. In addition, some chimeric genes display aberrant RNA levels
    for the whole organism, suggesting close physical association between
    sequences involved in tissue-specific regulatory differences and those
    important for Adh expression in the larval and adult fat bodies.

    Molecular chaperones, including the heat-shock proteins (Hsps), are a
    ubiquitous feature of cells in which these proteins cope with stress-induced
    denaturation of other proteins, Hsps have received the most attention in
    model organisms undergoing experimental stress in the laboratory, and the
    function of Hsps at the molecular and cellular level is becoming well
    understood in this context. A complementary focus is now emerging on the
    Hsps of both model and nonmodel organisms undergoing stress in nature, on
    the roles of Hsps in the stress physiology of whole multicellular eukaryotes
    and the tissues and organs they comprise, and on the ecological and
    evolutionary correlates of variation in Hsps and the genes that encode them.
    This focus discloses that (a) expression of Hsps can occur in nature, (b)
    all species have hsp genes but they vary in the patterns of their
    expression, (c) Hsp expression can be correlated with resistance to stress,
    and (d) species' thresholds for Hsp expression are correlated with levels of
    stress that they naturally undergo. These conclusions are now well
    established and may require little additional confirmation; many significant
    questions remain unanswered concerning both the mechanisms of Hsp-mediated
    stress tolerance at the organismal level and the evolutionary mechanisms
    that have diversified the hsp genes.

    The invertebrate pests most commonly affecting New Zealand’s pastoral-based
    production in ‘average’ years cause losses of between $1.7B and $2.3B p.a.
    of which up to $0.9B occur on sheep and beef farms and $1.4B on dairy farms.
    The native scarab grass grub is the most costly pest causing losses of
    $140–380 M on dairy farms and $75–205 M on sheep and beef farms annually.
    The exotic scarab, black beetle, although only affecting approximately 1 M
    ha, costs dairy farmers up to $223 M and sheep and beef farmers up to $19 M
    annually. Porina cause losses up to $84 M and $88 M respectively. Pasture
    nematodes are estimated to cost up to $274 M p.a. for dairy farmers and $326
    M p.a. for sheep and beef farmers. Two exotic pests, Argentine stem weevil
    (ASW) and clover root weevil (CRW) are causing damage estimated at up to
    $200 M p.a. and $235 M p.a. respectively in dairy and sheep and beef
    pastures. While CRW is subject to successful biological control management
    it still causes considerable losses. Lesser pests also contribute to lost
    production, particularly as they often coexist with more major pests.
    However, their economic cost to New Zealand is difficult to calculate due to
    the variable nature of infestations on both temporal and spatial scales. At
    farm and paddock level, it is abundantly clear that substantial savings
    could be made if pest management is achieved. It is equally clear that in
    many instances the tools to do so are limited but if developed would
    contribute substantially to farm profitability.

  abstract: "The epigenomic landscape of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. We performed a genomewide DNA methylation and a\_transcriptome studies in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived dopaminergic neurons (DAn) generated by cell reprogramming of somatic skin cells from patients with monogenic LRRK2‐associated PD (L2PD) or sporadic PD (sPD), and healthy subjects. We observed extensive DNA methylation changes in PD DAn, and of RNA expression, which were common in L2PD and sPD. No significant methylation differences were present in parental skin cells, undifferentiated iPSCs nor iPSC‐derived neural cultures not‐enriched‐in‐DAn. These findings suggest the presence of molecular defects in PD somatic cells which manifest only upon differentiation into the DAn cells targeted in PD. The methylation profile from PD DAn, but not from controls, resembled that of neural cultures not‐enriched‐in‐DAn indicating a failure to fully acquire the epigenetic identity own to healthy DAn in PD. The PD‐associated hypermethylation was prominent in gene regulatory regions such as enhancers and was related to the RNA and/or protein downregulation of a network of transcription factors relevant to PD (FOXA1, NR3C1, HNF4A, and FOSL2). Using a patient‐specific iPSC‐based DAn model, our study provides the first evidence that epigenetic deregulation is associated with monogenic and sporadic PD."

    The Rst(2)DDT locus (loci) in Drosophila is associated with the
    over-expression of two cytochrome P450 genes, Cyp6g1 and Cyp12d1. Using
    northern and western blot analysis we observed the expression pattern of
    these two genes in two DDT susceptible (Canton-S and 91-C) and three DDT
    resistant strains (Wisconsin, 91-R and Hikone-R). In Canton-S and 91-R, the
    CYP6G1 protein was constitutively expressed throughout development. In the
    Wisconsin strain, CYP6G1 was not expressed in third instar larvae unless the
    larvae are exposed to DDT. CYP12D1 protein was only expressed in adults.
    Cyp12d1 mRNA is induced in DDT resistant strains post-exposure to DDT and
    the expression patterns of Cyp12d1 mRNA varied across DDT resistant strains.
    Our data support the hypothesis that there is evolutionary plasticity in the
    expression patterns of P450s associated with metabolic pesticide resistance.

    Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the
    most common untreatable form of dementia. Identifying molecular biomarkers
    that allow early detection remains a key challenge in the diagnosis,
    treatment, and prognostic evaluation of the disease. Here, we report a novel
    experimental and analytical model characterizing epigenetic alterations
    during AD onset and progression. We generated the first integrated
    base-resolution genome-wide maps of the distribution of 5-methyl-cytosine
    (5mC), 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC), and 5-formyl/carboxy-cytosine
    (5fC/caC) in normal and AD neurons. We identified 27 AD region–specific and
    39 CpG site–specific epigenetic signatures that were independently validated
    across our familial and sporadic AD models, and in an independent clinical
    cohort. Thus, our work establishes a new model and strategy to study the
    epigenetic alterations underlying AD onset and progression and provides a
    set of highly reliable AD-specific epigenetic signatures that may have early
    diagnostic and prognostic implications.

    The discovery of AD epigenetic signatures lays a molecular basis for new
    methods to detect early AD using patient blood cells.

  abstract: >-
    The great diversity of P450 genes in a variety of organisms is well
    documented but not well explained. The number of CYP genes in each species
    is highly variable and this is shown here for arthropod, mainly insect
    CYPomes. Pairs of recognizable orthologs are but a small portion of the
    CYPome, but species- or lineage-specific expansions of CYP subfamilies are
    consistently observed. These “blooms” of CYP genes have their origin in
    multiple gene duplications, although some subfamilies expand and others do
    not. Stochastic birth and death models of CYP gene proliferation are
    sufficient to explain blooms, and speciation events may play important roles
    in CYPome diversity between lineages. Mitochondrial clan P450s are a
    monophyletic group of genes that has seen several blooms in insects, but
    apparently not in vertebrates.

    The first fully sequenced insect genomes were those of the fruitfly and the
    mosquito, both from the order Diptera. Now, with an increasing number and
    diversity of insect genomes becoming available, the diversity of insect P450
    genes can be better appreciated and tentative ideas about the evolution of
    the CYP (cytochrome P450) superfamily in insects can be proposed. There are
    four large clades of insect P450 genes that existed before the divergence of
    the class Insecta and that are also represented by CYP families in
    vertebrates: the CYP2 clade, the CYP3 clade, the CYP4 clade and the
    mitochondrial P450 clade. P450s with known or suspected physiological
    functions are present in each of these clades and only a dozen genes appear
    to have orthologues or very close paralogues in each insect genome. P450
    enzymes from each of these clades have been linked to insecticide resistance
    or to the metabolism of natural products and xenobiotics. In particular,
    insects appear to maintain a repertoire of mitochondrial P450 paralogues
    devoted to the response to environmental challenges.

    The recent accumulation of molecular studies on mutations in insects, ticks
    and mites conferring resistance to insecticides, acaricides and
    biopesticides is reviewed. Resistance is traditionally classified by
    physiological and biochemical criteria, such as target-site insensitivity
    and metabolic resistance. However, mutations are discrete molecular changes
    that differ in their intrinsic frequency, effects on gene dosage and fitness
    consequences. These attributes in turn impact the population genetics of
    resistance and resistance management strategies, thus calling for a
    molecular genetic classification. Mutations in structural genes remain the
    most abundantly described, mostly in genes coding for target proteins. These
    provide the most compelling examples of parallel mutations in response to
    selection. Mutations causing upregulation and downregulation of genes, both
    in cis (in the gene itself) and in trans (in regulatory processes) remain
    difficult to characterize precisely. Gene duplications and gene disruption
    are increasingly reported. Gene disruption appears prevalent in the case of
    multiple, hetero-oligomeric or redundant targets.

    This chapter discusses the insect CYP genes and P450 enzymes. Cytochrome
    P450, or CYP genes, constitutes one of the largest family of genes, with
    representatives in virtually all living organisms, from bacteria to
    protists, plants, fungi, and animals. The multiple functions of insect P450
    enzymes, their complex biochemistry, and their toxicological and
    physiological importance are presented. Physiological functions are not
    restricted to one branch of the P450 evolutionary tree, and the
    ramifications that seem typical of “environmental response genes” are found
    in both microsomal and mitochondrial P450 encoding genes. The CYP3 and CYP4
    clans seem the most diverse, and the smaller CYP2 and mitochondrial CYP
    clans seem to have proportionally more genes found as orthologs across
    species. There are many physiological functions for P450s that just are not
    known or suspected. CYP4C7 was shown to be selectively expressed in the
    corpora allata and to metabolize JH and its precursors to new metabolites.

    The P450 enzymes (mixed function oxidases, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases),
    a diverse class of enzymes found in virtually all insect tissues, fulfill
    many important tasks, from the synthesis and degradation of ecdysteroids and
    juvenile hormones to the metabolism of foreign chemicals of natural or
    synthetic origin. This diversity in function is achieved by a diversity in
    structure, as insect genomes probably carry about 100 P450 genes, sometimes
    arranged in clusters, and each coding for a different P450 enzyme. Both
    microsomal and mitochondrial P450s are present in insects and are best
    studied by heterologous expression of their cDNA and reconstitution of
    purified enzymes. P450 genes are under complex regulation, with induction
    playing a central role in the adaptation to plant chemicals and regulatory
    mutations playing a central role in insecticide resistance. Polymorphisms in
    induction or constitutive expression allow insects to scan their P450 gene
    repertoire for the appropriate response to chemical insults, and these
    evolutionary pressures in turn maintain P450 diversity.

    The past ten years have seen the elucidation of the molecular basis of
    insect resistance to many chemical insecticides. Target genes, mostly in the
    nervous system, have been identified and cloned from Drosophila melanogaster
    and resistance-associated mutations have been examined in a range of pest
    insects. More recently, with the advent of annotated insect genomes,
    resistance mediated by complex multi-gene enzyme systems such as esterases,
    cytochrome P450s and glutathione-S-transferases has also been elucidated. In
    this article, we review the impact of Drosophila genetics on the field of
    insect resistance and focus on the current and future impact of genomics.
    These studies enable us to address three fundamental questions in the
    evolution of resistance. How many genes are involved? How many mutations are
    there within these genes? How often do these mutations arise in natural
    populations?

    Cyclodiene resistance has accounted for over 60% of reported cases of
    insecticide resistance. Understanding of this resistance can therefore help
    us answer questions relating to the mechanism and origin of representative
    resistance-associated mutations, questions fundamental to the molecular and
    populations genetics of pesticide resistance. The cyclodiene resistance gene
    Rdl (resistance to dieldrin) was cloned from a mutant of the model insect
    Drosophila resistant to cyclodienes and picrotoxinin.; Rdl codes for a
    subunit of a novel class of GABA gated chloride ion channels and resistance
    is correlated with replacement of the same amino acid residue in a wide
    range of species from different insect orders. This single amino acid
    replacement Ala(302) > Ser, within the proposed lining of the chloride ion
    channel, also confers insensitivity to the blocking action of cyclodienes
    and picrotoxinin on GABA gated chloride ion channels expressed in Xenopus
    oocytes. The resistance mechanism involves both changes in cyclodiene
    binding site affinity and also a change in the rate of receptor
    desensitization which destabilizes the cyclodiene-favored conformation.
    Documentation of the resistance associated mutation has allowed for the
    design of a PCR based molecular monitoring technique. This technique gives
    more accurate estimates of resistance gene frequency from smaller sample
    sizes and has shown the frequency of resistance in apparently unselected
    populations of Drosophila to be as high as 1%. We are still uncertain as to
    why resistance persists in the apparent absence of selection pressure and
    any severe reduction in the fitness of resistant strains, besides a
    paralytic phenotype at high temperature, remains undocumented.

    VERTEBRATES and invertebrates both have GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) as a
    major inhibitory neurotransmitter1,2. GABA(A) receptors in vertebrates
    assemble as heteromultimers to form an integral chloride ion channel3. These
    receptors are targets for drugs and pesticides4 and are also implicated in
    seizure-related diseases5,6. Picrotoxinin (PTX) and cyclodiene insecticides
    are GABA(A) receptor antagonists which competitively displace each other
    from the same binding site7. Insects8 and vertebrates9 showing resistance to
    cyclodienes also show cross-resistance to PTX. Previously, we used a
    field-isolated Drosophila mutant Rdl (Resistant to dieldrin)10 insensitive
    to PTX and cyclodienes to clone a putative GABA receptor11. Here we report
    the functional expression and novel pharmacology of this GABA receptor and
    examine the functionality of a resistance-associated point mutation (alanine
    to serine) within the second membrane-spanning domain, the region thought to
    line the chloride ion channel pore. This substitution is found globally in
    Drosophila populations12. This mutation not only identifies a single amino
    acid conferring high levels of resistance to the important GABA receptor
    antagonist PTX but also, by conferring resistance to cyclodienes, may
    account for over 60% of reported cases of insecticide resistance13.

    The genes encoding the three major targets of conventional insecticides are:
    Rdl, which encodes a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit (RDL); para,
    which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel (PARA); and Ace, which encodes
    insect acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Interestingly, despite the complexity of
    the encoded receptors or enzymes, very few amino acid residues are replaced
    in different resistant insects: one within RDL, two within PARA and three or
    more within AChE. Here we examine the possible reasons underlying this
    extreme conservation by looking at the aspects of receptor and/or enzyme
    function that may constrain replacements to such a limited number of
    residues.

    Myzus persicae samples were collected from populations present on a range of
    field crops between 1997 and 2000. A combination of biochemical, DNA-based
    diagnostics and bioassays was used to assess the presence of three
    insecticide resistance mechanisms: elevated carboxylesterase (E4 or FE4),
    insensitive acetylcholinesterase and insensitive sodium channels (knockdown
    resistance, kdr). For the carboxylesterases, both the levels of enzyme and
    the type of gene present (E4 or FE4) were determined. The results showed
    that during the time period studied there was a dramatic reduction in the
    proportion of aphids with very high levels of E4 and an increase in those
    with lower levels of FE4. There was also a slightly different E4 gene
    present in a limited number of samples. The change in esterase genes was
    accompanied by a virtual loss of the insensitive AChE variant and a
    maintenance of aphids with kdr. The selection pressures and other factors
    leading to these changes in field populations of M persicae are discussed.

  abstract: >-
    The amplification of genes encoding the esterases E4 and FE4 is a widespread
    mechanism of insecticide resistance in the peach-potato aphid, Myzus
    persicae (Sulzer). We present evidence that in susceptible aphids the two
    genes are adjacent to each other in a head-to-tail arrangement with E4
    upstream of FE4 and with approx. 19 kb of intervening sequence. There are
    also at least two other closely related sequences which might come from
    other members of an esterase gene family, in line with reports of other
    insect gene families encoding detoxifying enzymes. The close identity
    between E4 and FE4 genes indicates a recent duplication and divergence. The
    subsequent amplifications giving multiple copies of either E4 or FE4 must
    have involved two separate events, each probably occurring once and then
    being selected by insecticide exposure and spread by migration. The cloning
    of sequences upstream of the FE4 gene suggest, by comparison with E4, that
    the two genes are regulated in different ways. FE4 has sequences
    corresponding to a conventional promoter (TATA box and CAP site) that are
    not present in E4; on the other hand, FE4 lacks the CpG island present 5' of
    E4 genes that may control expression through changes in DNA methylation. The
    differences are likely to have occurred by the duplication event that gave
    rise to E4 and FE4 leading to different 5' sequences.

    We have identified two mutations in the ace1 gene of Aphis gossypii that are
    associated with insensitivity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to carbamate
    and organophosphate insecticides. The first of these, S431F (equivalent to
    F331 in Torpedo californica), is associated with insensitivity to the
    carbamate insecticide pirimicarb in a range of A. gossypii clones. The S431F
    mutation is also found in the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer),
    and a rapid RFLP diagnostic allows the identification of individuals of both
    aphid species with a resistant genotype. This diagnostic further revealed
    the presence of S431 in several other pirimicarb-susceptible aphid species.
    The serine at this position in the wild-type enzyme has only been reported
    for aphids and provides a molecular explanation of why pirimicarb has a
    specific aphicidal action. A less specific insensitivity to a wide range of
    carbamates and organophosphates is associated with a second mutation, A302S
    (A201 in T. californica).

    cDNA clones for the esterase (E4) responsible for broad insecticide
    resistance in peach-potato aphids (Myzus persicae Sulz.) were isolated and
    used to study the molecular basis of resistance. Increased esterase
    synthesis by resistant aphids was found to be associated with amplification
    of the structural gene for the esterase (E4 or its closely related variant,
    FE4), the degree of amplification being correlated with the activity of the
    esterase and the level of resistance. Hybridization of the cDNA clones to
    genomic Southern blots showed that only some of the esterase-related
    restriction fragments are amplified. Qualitative differences between
    restriction patterns in different clones of resistant aphids correlated with
    the presence or absence of a specific chromosome translocation and with
    production of E4 or FE4.

  abstract: >-
    Overproduction of the insecticide-degrading esterases, E4 and FE4, in
    peach-potato aphids, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), depends on both gene
    amplification and transcriptional control, the latter being associated with
    changes in DNA methylation. The structure and function of the aphid esterase
    genes have been studied but the determination of their copy number has
    proved difficult, a common problem with gene amplification. We have now used
    a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and quantitative
    competitive PCR to determine relative esterase gene copy numbers in aphid
    clones with different levels of insecticide resistance (R-1, R-2 and R-3).
    There are approx. 4-fold increases between susceptible, R-1, R-2 and R-3
    aphids, reaching a maximum of approx. 80 times more genes in R-3; this gives
    proportionate increases in esterase protein relative to susceptible aphids.
    Thus there is no overexpression of the amplified genes, in contrast with
    what was thought previously. For E4 genes, the loss of 5-methylcytosine is
    correlated with a loss of expression, greatly decreasing the amount of
    enzyme relative to the copy number.

    Diamide insecticides such as chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide are a new
    class of insecticide that selectively target insect ryanodine receptors
    (RyR), a distinct class of homo-tetrameric calcium release channels which
    play a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis in numerous cell types.
    Resistance to these insecticides has recently been reported in the
    diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a global
    lepidopteran pest of cruciferous crops. In the present study a region of the
    gene encoding the proposed diamide binding site of the RyR from P.
    xylostella collected from the Philippines and Thailand and found to be over
    200-fold resistant to both chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide compared to
    susceptible strains, were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. Comparison of
    the sequence with those from several susceptible reference strains revealed
    non-synonymous mutations in each of the resistant strains that in both cases
    lead to a glycine to glutamic acid substitution (G4946E) in the protein. The
    independent evolution of the same amino acid substitution within a highly
    conserved region of the proposed diamide binding site in two geographically
    separated resistant strains of P. xylostella strongly suggests a causal
    association with diamide resistance. Furthermore we designed a
    pyrosequencing-based diagnostic assay for resistance monitoring purposes
    that can be used to detect the G4946E mutation in field-collected samples of
    diamondback moth. The implications of the reported findings for resistance
    management strategies are discussed.

    Recent years have seen a rapid increase in our understanding of how
    double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 21- to 25-nucleoticle small RNAs, microRNAs
    (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), control gene expression in
    eukaryotes. This RNA-mediated regulation generally results in
    sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression; this can occur at levels as
    different as chromatin modification and silencing, translational repression
    and mRNA degradation. Many details of the biogenesis and function of miRNAs

    the RNA interference (RNAi) and miRNA machineries is emerging, and provides
    some insight into the mechanism of RNA-silencing reactions.

    The copper-accumulating region of the midgut is a mosaic of interstitial and
    cup-shaped, copper-accumulating cells. The cup of each cuprophilic cell is
    lined with a highly refractile border of long microvilli except in one
    strain where it is predominantly lamellar. The nucleus lies basally; the
    basal plasma membrane is fairly extensively infolded. Cytolysomes are
    abundant and increase in number with increasing copper content of the diet.
    The interstitial cells bear short, less regular microvilli and have a less
    electron-dense cytoplasm. The nucleus is apical, the mitochondria-associated
    basal membrane is very extensively infolded and cytolysomes are less
    abundant. Virus-like particles present in nuclei of both cell types increase
    in number with increasing copper concentration.

  abstract: >-
    The genetic analysis of life span has only begun in mammals, invertebrates,
    such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, and yeast. Even at this
    primitive stage of the genetic analysis of aging, the physiological
    observations that rate of metabolism is intimately tied to life span is
    supported. In many examples from mice to worms to flies to yeast, genetic
    variants that affect life span also modify metabolism. Insulin signaling
    regulates life span coordinately with reproduction, metabolism, and free
    radical protective gene regulation in C. elegans. This may be related to the
    findings that caloric restriction also regulates mammalian aging, perhaps
    via the modulation of insulin-like signaling pathways. The nervous system
    has been implicated as a key tissue where insulin-like signaling and free
    radical protective pathways regulate life span in C. elegans and Drosophila.
    Genes that determine the life span could act in neuroendocrine cells in
    diverse animals. The involvement of insulin-like hormones suggests that the
    plasticity in life spans evident in animal phylogeny may be due to variation
    in the timing of release of hormones that control vitality and mortality as
    well as variation in the response to those hormones. Pedigree analysis of
    human aging may reveal variations in the orthologs of the insulin pathway
    genes and coupled pathways that regulate invertebrate aging. Thus, genetic
    approaches may identify a set of circuits that was established in ancestral
    metazoans to regulate their longevity.

    Pfam, available via servers in the UK (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) and the
    USA (http://pfam.janelia.org/), is a widely used database of protein
    families, containing 14 831 manually curated entries in the current release,
    version 27.0. Since the last update article 2 years ago, we have generated
    1182 new families and maintained sequence coverage of the UniProt
    Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) at nearly 80%, despite a 50% increase in the size
    of the underlying sequence database. Since our 2012 article describing Pfam,
    we have also undertaken a comprehensive review of the features that are
    provided by Pfam over and above the basic family data. For each feature, we
    determined the relevance, computational burden, usage statistics and the
    functionality of the feature in a website context. As a consequence of this
    review, we have removed some features, enhanced others and developed new
    ones to meet the changing demands of computational biology. Here, we
    describe the changes to Pfam content. Notably, we now provide family
    alignments based on four different representative proteome sequence data
    sets and a new interactive DNA search interface. We also discuss the mapping
    between Pfam and known 3D structures.

  abstract: >-
    Adaptation to adverse environmental conditions such as high altitude
    requires physiological and/or morphological changes. Genome scans provide a
    means to identify the genetic basis of such adaptations without previous
    knowledge about the particular genetic variants or traits under selection.
    In this study, we scanned 3027 amplified fragment length polymorphisms
    (AFLP) in four populations of the common vole Microtus arvalis for loci
    associated with local adaptation and high altitude. We investigated voles
    from two populations at high elevation (∼2000 m a.s.l.) representing the
    upper limit of the altitudinal distribution of the species and two
    geographically close low-altitude populations (<600 m a.s.l.). Statistical
    analysis incorporated a new Bayesian FST outlier approach specifically
    developed for AFLP markers, which considers the intensity of AFLP bands
    instead of mere presence/absence and allows to derive population-based
    estimates of allele frequencies and FIS values. Computer simulations showed
    that this approach increases the statistical power of the detection of AFLP
    markers under selection almost to the power of single nucleotide
    polymorphism (SNP) data without compromising specificity. Our enhanced
    genome scan resulted in 20 prime candidate markers for positive selection,
    which show mostly extremely high allele frequency differences between the
    low- and high-altitude populations. The comparison of global- and
    pairwise-enhanced genome scans demonstrated further that very strong
    selective signatures may also be associated with single populations
    suggesting the importance of local adaptation in alpine populations of
    common voles.

    In vertebrates, cytochrome P450s of the CYP2 and CYP3 families play a
    dominant role in drug metabolism, while in insects members of the CYP6 and
    CYP28 families have been implicated in metabolism of insecticides and toxic
    natural plant compounds. A degenerate 3' RACE strategy resulted in the
    identification of fifteen novel P450s from an alkaloid-resistant species of
    Drosophila. The strong (17.4-fold) and highly specific induction of a single
    gene (CYP4D10) by the toxic isoquinoline alkaloids of a commonly utilized
    host-plant (saguaro cactus) provides the first indication that members of
    the CYP4 family in insects may play an important role in the maintenance of
    specific insect-host plant relationships. Strong barbiturate inducibility of
    CYP4D10 and two other D. mettleri P450 sequences of the CYP4 family was also
    observed, suggesting a pattern of xenobiotic responsiveness more similar to
    those of several vertebrate drug-metabolizing enzymes than to putative
    vertebrate CYP4 homologs.

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450s constitute a superfamily of genes encoding mostly
    microsomal hemoproteins that play a dominant role in the metabolism of a
    wide variety of both endogenous and foreign compounds, In insects,
    xenobiotic metabolism (i.e., metabolism of insecticides and toxic natural
    plant compounds) is known to involve members of the CYP6 family of
    cytochrome P450s. Use of a 3' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)
    strategy with a degenerate primer based on the conserved cytochrome P450
    heme-binding decapeptide loop resulted in the amplification of four cDNA
    sequences representing another family of cytochrome P450 genes (CW28) from
    two species of isoquinoline alkaloid-resistant Drosophila and the
    cosmopolitan species Drosophila hydei, The CW28 family forms a monophyletic
    clade with strong regional homologies to the vertebrate CYP3 family and the
    insect CYP6 family (both of which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism) and
    to the insect CYP9 family (of unknown function), Induction of mRNA levels
    for three of the CYP28 cytochrome P450s by toxic host-plant allelochemicals
    (up to 11.5-fold) and phenobarbital (up to 49-fold) corroborates previous in
    vitro metabolism studies and suggests a potentially important role for the
    CYP28 family in determining patterns of insect-host-plant relationships
    through xenobiotic detoxification.

  abstract: >-
    Several species of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert contain isoquinoline
    alkaloids that are toxic to all but the resident drosophilids that feed and
    breed in necrotic stems. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to be involved in
    the metabolic detoxification of these alkaloids by the desert Drosophila and
    are consequently responsible for their ability to utilize these substrates.
    D. melanogaster is not normally exposed to these xenobiotic compounds and
    cannot live in necrotic cactus tissue. However, a previous study found
    evidence of a phenobarbital-inducible P450 in adults of this species that is
    capable of metabolizing cactus alkaloids. The current investigation sought
    to determine whether D. melanogaster responds to selection for alkaloid
    resistance. Significant increases in larval viability and adult longevity as
    well as shorter larvae-to-adult development times were observed after 16
    generations of selection on medium containing isoquinoline alkaloids. The
    selected lines that exhibited a positive response can now be used to assay
    for changes in gene regulation as a possible mechanism of their response.
    This information will contribute to the understanding of evolution of
    P450-mediated resistance in insects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

    Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great
    interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate
    neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population
    differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an
    approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to
    selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of
    dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to
    complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we
    show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong
    bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we
    demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the
    populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two
    previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a
    Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed
    sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified
    fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The
    method has been implemented in a new software available at our website
    (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).

    MADS box transcription factors controlling flower development have been

    have functions in plant development, like controlling the transition from
    vegetative to reproductive growth, determination of floral organ identity,
    and regulation of fruit maturation. In this paper we report the functional
    analysis of OsMADS18. This rice MADS box gene is widely expressed in rice
    with its transcripts accumulated to higher levels in meristems.
    Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed
    histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot
    meristems was accelerated. Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference
    approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating
    that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription
    factors. Surprisingly, overexpression of OsMADS18 in Arabidopsis caused a
    phenotype closely resembling the ap1 mutant. We show that the ap1 phenotype
    is not caused by down-regulation of AP1 expression. Yeast two-hybrid
    experiments showed that some of the natural partners of AP1 interact with
    OsMADS18, suggesting that the OsMADS18 overexpression phenotype in
    Arabidopsis is likely to be due to the subtraction of AP1 partners from
    active transcription complexes. Thus, when compared to AP1, OsMADS18 during
    evolution seems to have conserved the mechanistic properties of
    protein-protein interactions, although it cannot complement the AP1
    function.

    Steroid hormones mediate a wide variety of developmental and physiological
    events in insects, yet little is known about the genetics of insect steroid
    hormone biosynthesis. Here we describe the Drosophila dare gene, which
    encodes adrenodoxin reductase (AR). In mammals, AR plays a key role in the
    synthesis of all steroid hormones. Null mutants of dare undergo
    developmental arrest during the second larval instar or at the second larval
    molt, and dare mutants of intermediate severity are delayed in pupariation.
    These defects are rescued to a high degree by feeding mutant larvae the
    insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. These data, together with the
    abundant expression of dare in the two principal steroid biosynthetic
    tissues, the ring gland and the ovary, argue strongly for a role of dare in
    steroid hormone production. dare is the first Drosophila gene shown to
    encode a defined component of the steroid hormone biosynthetic cascade and
    therefore provides a new tool for the analysis of steroid hormone function.
    We have explored its role in the adult nervous system and found two striking
    phenotypes not previously described in mutants affected in steroid hormone
    signaling. First, we show that mild reductions of dare expression cause
    abnormal behavioral responses to olfactory stimuli, indicating a requirement
    for dare in sensory behavior. Then we show that dare mutations of
    intermediate strength result in rapid, widespread degeneration of the adult
    nervous system.

    exon-intron structure. Both the heme-binding motif and a region diagnostic
    for family 4 are not interrupted by introns. CYP4D2 lies 20 kb proximal to
    the previously described CYP4DI gene (Gandhi et al., 1992). In addition to
    CYP4DI and CYP4D2, two other DNA fragments homologous to P450 genes are
    detected within the wapl-prune region.

    In the last decade the tumultuous development of "omics" greatly improved
    our ability to understand protein structure, function and evolution, and to

    applications, from the development of biomolecules with novel properties of
    industrial and medical importance, to the creation of transgenic organisms
    with new, favorable characteristics.This review focuses on glutathione

    all eukaryotic organisms, and attempts to give an overview of the new
    insights and perspectives provided by omics into the biology of these

  abstract: >-
    Flight control in insects depends on self-induced image motion (optic flow),
    which the visual system must process to generate appropriate corrective
    steering maneuvers. Classic experiments in tethered insects applied rigorous
    system identification techniques for the analysis of turning reactions in
    the presence of rotating pattern stimuli delivered in open-loop. However,
    the functional relevance of these measurements for visual free-flight
    control remains equivocal due to the largely unknown effects of the highly
    constrained experimental conditions. To perform a systems analysis of the
    visual flight speed response under free-flight conditions, we implemented a
    'one-parameter open-loop' paradigm using 'TrackFly' in a wind tunnel
    equipped with real-time tracking and virtual reality display technology.
    Upwind flying flies were stimulated with sine gratings of varying temporal
    and spatial frequencies, and the resulting speed responses were measured
    from the resulting flight speed reactions. To control flight speed, the
    visual system of the fruit fly extracts linear pattern velocity robustly
    over a broad range of spatio-temporal frequencies. The speed signal is used
    for a proportional control of flight speed within locomotor limits. The
    extraction of pattern velocity over a broad spatio-temporal frequency range
    may require more sophisticated motion processing mechanisms than those
    identified in flies so far. In Drosophila, the neuromotor pathways
    underlying flight speed control may be suitably explored by applying
    advanced genetic techniques, for which our data can serve as a baseline.
    Finally, the high-level control principles identified in the fly can be
    meaningfully transferred into a robotic context, such as for the robust and
    efficient control of autonomous flying micro air vehicles.

    In Drosophila, sexual differentian, physiology, and behaviour are thought to
    be mediated by numerous male- and female-specific effector genes whose
    expression is controlled by sex-specifically expressed nanscriptional
    regulators. One such downstream effector gene, sex-specific enzyme 1 (sxe1,
    cyp4d2l), has been identified in a screen for genes with sex-biased
    expression in the head. Sxe1 was also identified in another screen as a
    circadian regulated gene. Here, we analyzed the spatial and temporal
    regulation of Sxe! and identified a function for this gene i male courtship.
    We show that male-specific transcriptional regulator DSXM and the clock
    genes are necessary for cycling of Sxe1 m RNA during the diurnal cycle.
    Similar to sxe1 mRNA, expression of SXE1 protein oscillates in a diurnal
    fashion, with highest protein levels occurring arround midnight. SXE1
    protein expression is restricted to nonneuronal cells assoicated with
    diverse sensory bristles of both the chemo-and mechanosensory systems.
    Suppression or knockout of sxe1 significantly reduces mating success
    throughout the diurnal cycle. Finally, the metabolomic profile of wild-type
    and sxe1 mutant males reveald that sxe1 likely functions as fauy acid
    omega-hydroxylase, suggesting that male courtship and mating success is
    ediated by small compounds generated by this enzyme.

    Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) mediates the induction of heat
    shock proteins in response to various types of stress. Although HSF1
    activity is regulated by its post-translational modifications, alterations
    in mRNA expression have also been suggested. We here identified three new
    alternatively spliced isoforms of Drosophila HSF (dHSF) mRNA, named dHSFb,
    dHSFc, and dHSFd. We found that the ratio of dHSFb increases upon heat
    exposure, while that of dHSFd increases upon cold exposure. The dHSFc and
    dHSFd isoforms showed greater transcriptional activity than the other
    isoforms. Our findings suggest that alternative splicing regulates the
    transcriptional activity of dHSF. (c) 2005 Federation of European

  abstract: >-
    A long awn is one of the distinct morphological features of wild rice
    species. This organ is thought to aid in seed dispersal and prevent
    predation by animals. Most cultivated varieties of Oryza sativa and Oryza
    glaberrima, however, have lost the ability to form long awns. The causal
    genetic factors responsible for the loss of awn in these two rice species
    remain largely unknown. Here, we evaluated three sets of chromosome segment
    substitution lines (CSSLs) in a common O. sativa genetic background (cv.
    Koshihikari) that harbor genomic fragments from O. nivara, O. rufipogon and
    O. glaberrima donors. Phenotypic analyses of these libraries revealed the
    existence of three genes, Regulator of Awn Elongation 1 (RAE1), RAE2, and
    RAE3 involved in the loss of long awns in cultivated rice. Donor segments at
    two of these genes, RAE1 and RAE2, induced long awn formation in the CSSLs
    whereas an O. sativa segment at RAE3 induced long awn formation in O.
    glaberrima. These results suggest that the two cultivated rice species, O.
    sativa and O. glaberrima, have taken independent paths to become awnless.

    The basic structure of a rice inflorescence (the panicle) is determined by
    the pattern of branch formation, which is established at the early stages of
    panicle development. In this study we conducted global transcriptome
    profiling of the early stages of rice panicle development from phase
    transition to floral organ differentiation. To generate a meristem-specific
    gene-expression profile, shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and subsequently
    formed, very young panicles were collected manually and used for cDNA
    microarray analysis. We identified 357 out of 22,000 genes that are
    expressed differentially in the early stages of panicle development, and the
    357 genes were classified into seven groups based on their temporal
    expression patterns. The most noticeable feature is that a fairly small
    number of genes, which are extensively enriched in transcription factors,
    are upregulated in the SAM immediately after phase transition. In situ
    hybridization analysis showed that each gene analysed exhibits a unique and
    interesting localization of mRNA. Remarkably, one of the transcription
    factors was proven to be a close downstream component of the pathway in
    which LAX, a major regulator of panicle branching, acts. These results
    suggest that our strategy–careful collection of meristems, global
    transcriptome analysis and subsequent in situ hybridization analysis–is
    useful not only to obtain a genome-wide view of gene expression, but also to
    reveal genetic networks controlling rice panicle development.

    This theme issue pursues an exploration of the potential of taking into
    account the environmental sensitivity of development to explaining the
    evolution of metazoan life cycles, with special focus on complex life cycles
    and the role of developmental plasticity. The evolution of switches between
    alternative phenotypes as a response to different environmental cues and the
    evolution of the control of the temporal expression of alternative
    phenotypes within an organism's life cycle are here treated together as
    different dimensions of the complex relationships between genotype and
    phenotype, fostering the emergence of a more general and comprehensive
    picture of phenotypic evolution through a quite diverse sample of case
    studies. This introductory article reviews fundamental facts and concepts
    about phenotypic plasticity, adopting the most authoritative terminology in
    use in the current literature. The main topics are types and components of
    phenotypic variation, the evolution of organismal traits through plasticity,
    the origin and evolution of phenotypic plasticity and its adaptive value.

  abstract: >-
    Clustering is an important tool in microarray data analysis. This
    unsupervised learning technique is commonly used to reveal structures hidden
    in large gene expression data sets. The vast majority of clustering
    algorithms applied so far produce hard partitions of the data, i.e. each
    gene is assigned exactly to one cluster. Hard clustering is favourable if
    clusters are well separated. However, this is generally not the case for
    microarray time-course data, where gene clusters frequently overlap.
    Additionally, hard clustering algorithms are often highly sensitive to
    noise. To overcome the limitations of hard clustering, we applied soft
    clustering which offers several advantages for researchers. First, it
    generates accessible internal cluster structures, i.e. it indicates how well
    corresponding clusters represent genes. This can be used for the more
    targeted search for regulatory elements. Second, the overall relation
    between clusters, and thus a global clustering structure, can be defined.
    Additionally, soft clustering is more noise robust and a priori
    pre-filtering of genes can be avoided. This prevents the exclusion of
    biologically relevant genes from the data analysis. Soft clustering was
    implemented here using the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Procedures to find
    optimal clustering parameters were developed. A software package for soft
    clustering has been developed based on the open-source statistical language
    R. The package called Mfuzz is freely available.

    RNA-seq experiments generate reads derived not only from mature RNA
    transcripts but also from pre-mRNA. Here we present a computational approach
    called exon-intron split analysis (EISA) that measures changes in mature RNA
    and pre-mRNA reads across different experimental conditions to quantify
    transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. We
    apply EISA to 17 diverse data sets to show that most intronic reads arise
    from nuclear RNA and changes in intronic read counts accurately predict
    changes in transcriptional activity. Furthermore, changes in
    post-transcriptional regulation can be predicted from differences between
    exonic and intronic changes. EISA reveals both transcriptional and
    post-transcriptional contributions to expression changes, increasing the
    amount of information that can be gained from RNA-seq data sets.

    The variety of plant architectures observed in nature is predominantly
    determined by vegetative and reproductive branching patterns, the
    positioning of lateral organs, and differential stem elongation. Branches,
    lateral organs, and stems are the final products of the activity of
    meristems, groups of stem cells whose function is genetically determined and
    environmentally influenced. Several decades of studies in different plant
    species have shed light on the essential role of the hormone auxin in plant
    growth and development. Auxin influences stem elongation and regulates the
    formation, activity, and fate of meristems, and has therefore been
    recognized as a major hormone shaping plant architecture. Increasing our
    knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that regulate auxin function is
    necessary to understand how different plant species integrate a genetically
    determined developmental programme, the establishment of a body plan, with
    constant inputs from the surrounding environment. This information will
    allow us to develop the molecular tools needed to modify plant architecture
    in several crop species and in rapidly changing environments.

    The remarkable plasticity of post-embryonic plant development is due to
    groups of stem-cell-containing structures called meristems. In the shoot,
    meristems continuously produce organs such as leaves, flowers, and stems.
    Nearly two decades ago the WUSCHEL/CLAVATA (WUS/CLV) negative feedback loop
    was established as being essential for regulating the size of shoot
    meristems by maintaining a delicate balance between stem cell proliferation
    and cell recruitment for the differentiation of lateral primordia. Recent
    research in various model species (Arabidopsis, tomato, maize, and rice) has
    led to discoveries of additional components that further refine and improve
    the current model of meristem regulation, adding new complexity to a vital
    network for plant growth and productivity.

  abstract: >-
    Land plants have evolved increasingly complex regulatory modes of their
    flowering time (or heading date in crops). Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a
    short-day plant that flowers more rapidly in short-day but delays under
    long-day conditions. Previous studies have shown that the CO-FT module
    initially identified in long-day plants (Arabidopsis) is evolutionary
    conserved in short-day plants (Hd1-Hd3a in rice). However, in rice, there is
    a unique Ehd1-dependent flowering pathway that is Hd1-independent. Here, we
    report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early
    heading date 4 (Ehd4). ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under
    natural long-day conditions. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd4 encodes a
    novel CCCH-type zinc finger protein, which is localized to the nucleus and
    is able to bind to nucleic acids in vitro and transactivate transcription in
    yeast, suggesting that it likely functions as a transcriptional regulator.
    Ehd4 expression is most active in young leaves with a diurnal expression
    pattern similar to that of Ehd1 under both short-day and long-day
    conditions. We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen"
    genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known
    Ehd1 regulators. Strikingly, Ehd4 is highly conserved in the Oryza genus
    including wild and cultivated rice, but has no homologs in other species,
    suggesting that Ehd4 is originated along with the diversification of the
    Oryza genus from the grass family during evolution. We conclude that Ehd4 is
    a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential
    role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice.

  abstract: >-
    Grass plants develop distinct inflorescences and spikelets that determine
    grain yields. However, the mechanisms underlying the specification of
    inflorescences and spikelets in grasses remain largely unknown. Here, we
    report the biological role of one SEPALLATA (SEP)-like gene, OsMADS34, in
    controlling the development of inflorescences and spikelets in rice (Oryza
    sativa). OsMADS34 encodes a MADS box protein containing a short carboxyl
    terminus without transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. We
    demonstrate the ubiquitous expression of OsMADS34 in roots, leaves, and
    primordia of inflorescence and spikelet organs. Compared with the wild type,
    osmads34 mutants developed altered inflorescence morphology, with an
    increased number of primary branches and a decreased number of secondary
    branches. In addition, osmads34 mutants displayed a decreased spikelet
    number and altered spikelet morphology, with lemma/leaf-like elongated
    sterile lemmas. Moreover, analysis of the double mutant osmads34 osmads1
    suggests that OsMADS34 specifies the identities of floral organs, including
    the lemma/palea, lodicules, stamens, and carpel, in combination with another
    rice SEP-like gene, OsMADS1. Collectively, our study suggests that the
    origin and diversification of OsMADS34 and OsMADS1 contribute to the origin
    of distinct grass inflorescences and spikelets.

    High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) promises a comprehensive picture of
    the transcriptome, allowing for the complete annotation and quantification
    of all genes and their isoforms across samples. Realizing this promise
    requires increasingly complex computational methods. These computational
    challenges fall into three main categories: (i) read mapping, (ii)
    transcriptome reconstruction and (iii) expression quantification. Here we
    explain the major conceptual and practical challenges, and the general
    classes of solutions for each category. Finally, we highlight the
    interdependence between these categories and discuss the benefits for
    different biological applications.

    The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway promotes the rapid
    degradation of mRNAs containing premature stop codons (PTCs). In
    Caenorhabditis elegans, seven genes (smg1-7) playing an essential role in
    NMD have been identified. Only SMG2-4 (known as UPF1-3) have orthologs in
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that the Drosophila orthologs of
    UPF1-3, SMG1, SMG5 and SMG6 are required for the degradation of
    PTC-containing mRNAs, but that there is no SMG7 ortholog in this organism.
    In contrast, orthologs of SMG5-7 are encoded by the human genome and all
    three are required for NMD. In human cells, exon boundaries have been shown
    to play a critical role in defining PTCs. This role is mediated by
    components of the exon junction complex (EJC). Contrary to expectation,
    however, we show that the components of the EJC are dispensable for NMD in
    Drosophila cells. Consistently, PTC definition occurs independently of exon
    boundaries in Drosophila. Our findings reveal that despite conservation of
    the NMD machinery, different mechanisms have evolved to discriminate
    premature from natural stop codons in metazoa.

  abstract: >-
    The ecdysone receptor is a heterodimer of two nuclear receptors, the
    Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP). In Drosophila melanogaster,
    three EcR isoforms share common DNA and ligand-binding domains, but these
    proteins differ in their most N-terminal regions and, consequently, in the
    activation domains (AF1s) contained therein. The transcriptional
    coactivators for these domains, which impart unique transcriptional
    regulatory properties to the EcR isoforms, are unknown. Activating
    transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a basic-leucine zipper transcription factor
    that plays a central role in the stress response of mammals. Here we show
    that Cryptocephal (CRC), the Drosophila homolog of ATF4, is an ecdysone
    receptor coactivator that is specific for isoform B2. CRC interacts with
    EcR-B2 to promote ecdysone-dependent expression of ecdysis-triggering
    hormone (ETH), an essential regulator of insect molting behavior. We propose
    that this interaction explains some of the differences in transcriptional
    properties that are displayed by the EcR isoforms, and similar interactions
    may underlie the differential activities of other nuclear receptors with
    distinct AF1-coactivators.

    Identifying genomic regions with unusually high local haplotype homozygosity
    represents a powerful strategy to characterize candidate genes responding to
    natural or artificial positive selection. To that end, statistics measuring
    the extent of haplotype homozygosity within (e.g. EHH, iHS) and between (Rsb
    or XP-EHH) populations have been proposed in the literature. The rehh
    package for r was previously developed to facilitate genome-wide scans of
    selection, based on the analysis of long-range haplotypes. However, its
    performance was not sufficient to cope with the growing size of available
    data sets. Here, we propose a major upgrade of the rehh package, which
    includes an improved processing of the input files, a faster algorithm to
    enumerate haplotypes, as well as multithreading. As illustrated with the
    analysis of large human haplotype data sets, these improvements decrease the
    computation time by more than one order of magnitude. This new version of
    rehh will thus allow performing iHS-, Rsb- or XP-EHH-based scans on large
    data sets. The package rehh 2.0 is available from the CRAN repository
    (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rehh/index.html) together with help
    files and a detailed manual.

    The braconid wasp Fopius arisanus (Sonan) is an important biological control
    agent of tropical and subtropical pest fruit flies including two important
    global pests, the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), and the
    oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis). The goal of this study was to
    develop foundational genomic resources for this species to provide tools
    that can be used to answer questions exploring the multitrophic interactions
    between the host and parasitoid in this important research system. Here we
    present the a whole genome assembly of F. arisanus, derived from pooled
    haploid offspring from a single unmated female. The genome is approximately
    154 Mb in size, with a N50 contig and scaffold size of 51,867 bp and 0.98
    Mb, respectively. Utilizing existing RNA-Seq data for this species, as well
    as publicly available peptide sequences from related hymenopterans, a high
    quality gene annotation set, which includes 10,991 protein coding genes, was
    generated. Prior to this assembly submission, no RefSeq proteins were
    present for this species. Parasitic wasps play an important role in a
    diverse ecosystem as well as a role in biological control of agricultural
    pests. This whole genome assembly and annotation data represents the first
    genome-scale assembly for this species or any closely related Opiine, and
    are publicly available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
    Genome and RefSeq databases, providing a much needed genomic resource for
    this hymenopteran group.

    Cellular expansive growth is one of the foundations of morphogenesis. In
    plant and fungal cells, expansive growth is ultimately determined by
    manipulating the mechanics of the cell wall. Therefore, theoretical and
    biophysical descriptions of cellular growth processes focus on mathematical
    models of cell wall biomechanical responses to tensile stresses, produced by
    the turgor pressure. To capture and explain the biological processes they
    describe, mathematical models need quantitative information on relevant
    biophysical parameters, geometry and cellular structure. The increased use
    of mechanical modeling approaches in plant and fungal cell biology
    emphasizes the need for the concerted development of both disciplines and
    underlines the obligation of biologists to understand basic biophysical
    principles.

    The serotonin transporter is an important regulator of serotonergic
    signaling. In order to analyze where the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of
    the mammalian serotonin transporter (dSERT) is expressed in the nervous
    system, a dSERT antibody serum was used. Ectopic expression studies and loss
    of function analysis revealed that the dSERT antibody serum specifically
    recognizes dSERT. It was shown that in the embryonic nervous system dSERT is
    expressed in a subset of Engrailed-positive neurons. In the larval brain,
    dSERT is exclusively expressed in serotonergic neurons, all of which express
    dSERT. dSERT-positive neurons surround almost all brain neuropiles. In the
    mushroom body of the adult brain, extrinsic serotonergic neurons expressing
    dSERT engulf the mushroom body lobes. These neurons show regional
    differences in dSERT and serotonin expression. At the presynaptic terminals,
    serotonin release is sterically linked to serotonin reuptake. In contrast to
    this, there are other areas in serotonergic neurons where dSERT expression
    and/or function are uncoupled from synaptic neurotransmitter recycling and
    serotonin release. The localization pattern of dSERT can be employed to
    further understanding and analysis of serotonergic networks.

    Molting is elicited by a critical titer of ecdysteroids that includes the
    principal molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), and ecdysone (E), which
    is the precursor of 20E but also has morphogenetic of its own. The
    prothoracic glands are the predominate source of ecdysteroids, and the rate
    of synthesis of these polyhydroxylated sterols is critical for molting and
    metamorphosis. This review concerns three aspects of ecdysteroidogenesis:
    (a) how the brain neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PTT11) initiates
    a transductory cascade in cells of the prothoracic gland, which results hi
    an increased rate of ecdysteroid biosynthesis (upregulation): (b) how the
    concentrations of 20E in the hemolymph feed back on the prothoracic gland to
    decrease rates of ecdysteroidogenesis (downregulation): and (c) how the
    prothoracic gland cells convert cholesterol to the precursor of E and then
    20E, a series of reactions only now being understood because of the use of a
    combination of classical biochemistry and molecular genetics.

    Mutation of members of the Halloween gene family results in embryonic
    lethality. We have shown that two of these genes code for enzymes
    responsible for specific steps in the synthesis of ecdysone, a
    polyhydroxylated sterol that is the precursor of the major molting hormone
    of all arthropods, 20-hydroxyecdysone. These two mitochondrial P450 enzymes,
    coded for by disembodied (dib) (CYP302A1) and shadow (sad) (CYP315A1), are
    the C22 and C2 hydroxylases, respectively, as shown by transfection of the
    gene into S2 cells and subsequent biochemical analysis. These are the last
    two enzymes in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. A third enzyme, necessary
    for the critical conversion of ecdysone to 20-hydroxyecdysone, the
    20-monooxygenase, is encoded by shade (shd) (CYP314A1). All three enzymes
    are mitochondrial although shade has motifs suggesting both mitochondrial
    and microsomal locations. By tagging these enzymes, their subcellular
    location has been confirmed by confocal microscopy. Shade is present in
    several tissues as expected while disembodied and shadow are restricted to
    the ring gland. The paradigm used should allow us to define the enzymes
    mediating the entire ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway.

    Myriad experiences produce transient memory, yet, contingent on the internal
    state of the organism and the saliency of the experience, only some memories
    persist over time. How experience and internal state influence the duration
    of memory at the molecular level remains unknown. A self-assembled
    aggregated state of Drosophila Orb2A protein is required specifically for
    long-lasting memory. We report that in the adult fly brain the mRNA encoding
    Orb2A protein exists in an unspliced non-protein-coding form. The
    convergence of experience and internal drive transiently increases the
    spliced protein-coding Orb2A mRNA. A screen identified pasilla, the fly
    ortholog of mammalian Nova-1/2, as a mediator of Orb2A mRNA processing. A
    single-nucleotide substitution in the intronic region that reduces Pasilla
    binding and intron removal selectively impairs long-term memory. We posit
    that pasilla-mediated processing of unspliced Orb2A mRNA integrates
    experience and internal state to control Orb2A protein abundance and
    long-term memory formation.

    <h3>Abstract</h3> <p>Nanopore sequencing technology can rapidly and directly
    interrogate native DNA molecules. Often we are interested only in
    interrogating specific areas at high depth, but conventional enrichment
    methods have thus far proved unsuitable for long reads^1^. Existing
    strategies are currently limited by high input DNA requirements, low yield,
    short (&lt;5kb) reads, time-intensive protocols, and/or amplification or
    cloning (losing base modification information). In this paper, we describe a
    technique utilizing the ability of Cas9 to introduce cuts at specific
    locations and ligating nanopore sequencing adaptors directly to those sites,
    a method we term ‘nanopore Cas9 Targeted-Sequencing’ (nCATS).</p><p>We have
    demonstrated this using an Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cell (Capacity
    &gt;10Gb+) to generate a median 165X coverage at 10 genomic loci with a
    median length of 18kb, representing a several hundred-fold improvement over
    the 2-3X coverage achieved without enrichment. We performed a pilot run on
    the smaller Flongle flow cell (Capacity \~1Gb), generating a median coverage
    of 30X at 11 genomic loci with a median length of 18kb. Using panels of
    guide RNAs, we show that the high coverage data from this method enables us
    to (1) profile DNA methylation patterns at cancer driver genes, (2) detect
    structural variations at known hot spots, and (3) survey for the presence of
    single nucleotide mutations. Together, this provides a low-cost method that
    can be applied even in low resource settings to directly examine cellular
    DNA. This technique has extensive clinical applications for assessing
    medically relevant genes and has the versatility to be a rapid and
    comprehensive diagnostic tool. We demonstrate applications of this technique
    by examining the well-characterized GM12878 cell line as well as three
    breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) with varying tumorigenic
    potential as a model for cancer.</p><h3>Contributions</h3> <p>TG and WT

    Background: During their life, multicellular organisms are challenged with
    oxidative stress. It is generated by several reactive oxygen species (ROS),
    may limit lifespan and has been related to several human diseases. ROS can
    generate a wide variety of defects in many cellular components and thus the
    response of the organism challenged with oxidative stress may share some
    features with other stress responses. Conversely, in spite of recent
    progress, a complete functional analysis of the transcriptional responses to
    different oxidative stresses in model organisms is still missing. In
    addition, the functional significance of observed transcriptional changes is
    still elusive.Results: We used oligonucleotide microarrays to address the
    specificities of transcriptional responses of adult Drosophila to different
    stresses induced by paraquat and H2O2, two oxidative stressors, and by
    tunicamycin which induces an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress. Both
    specific and common responses to the three stressors were observed and whole
    genome functional analysis identified several important classes of stress
    responsive genes. Within some functional classes, we observed that isozymes
    do not all behave similarly, which may reflect unsuspected functional
    specificities. Moreover, genetic experiments performed on a subset of lines
    bearing mutations in genes identified in microarray experiments showed that
    a significant number of these mutations may affect resistance of adult
    Drosophila to oxidative stress.Conclusions: A long term common stress
    response to paraquat- or H2O2-induced oxidative stresses and ER stress is
    observed for a significant number of genes. Besides this common response,
    the unexpected complexity of the stress responses to oxidative and ER
    stresses in Drosophila, suggest significant specificities in protective
    properties between genes associated to the same functional classes.
    According to our functional analysis, a large part of the genome may play a
    role in protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in Drosophila.

    Genomic tools such as the availability of the Drosophila genome sequence,
    the relative ease of stable transformation, and DNA microarrays have made
    the fruit fly a powerful model in insecticide toxicology research. We have
    used transgenic promoter-GFP constructs to document the detailed pattern of
    induced Cyp6a2 gene expression in larval and adult Drosophila tissues. We
    also compared various insecticides and xenobiotics for their ability to
    induce this cytochrome P450 gene, and show that the pattern of Cyp6a2
    inducibility is comparable to that of vertebrate CYP2B genes, and different
    from that of vertebrate CYP1A genes, suggesting a degree of evolutionary
    conservation for the "phenobarbital-type" induction mechanism. Our results
    are compared to the increasingly diverse reports on P450 induction that can
    be gleaned from whole genome or from "detox" microarray experiments in
    Drosophila. These suggest that only a third of the genomic repertoire of CYP
    genes is inducible by xenobiotics, and that there are distinct subsets of
    inducers/induced genes, suggesting multiple xenobiotic transduction
    mechanisms. A relationship between induction and resistance is not supported
    by expression data from the literature. The relative abundance of expression
    data now available is in contrast to the paucity of studies on functional
    expression of P450 enzymes, and this remains a challenge for our
    understanding of the toxicokinetic aspects of insecticide action. (C) 2009

    The complementarity of gene expression and protein–DNA interaction data led
    to several successful models of biological systems. However, recent studies
    in multiple species raise doubts about the relationship between these two
    datasets. These studies show that the overwhelming majority of genes bound
    by a particular transcription factor (TF) are not affected when that factor
    is knocked out. Here, we show that this surprising result can be partially
    explained by considering the broader cellular context in which TFs operate.
    Factors whose functions are not backed up by redundant paralogs show a
    fourfold increase in the agreement between their bound targets and the
    expression levels of those targets. In addition, we show that incorporating
    protein interaction networks provides physical explanations for knockout
    effects. New double knockout experiments support our conclusions. Our
    results highlight the robustness provided by redundant TFs and indicate that
    in the context of diverse cellular systems, binding is still largely
    functional.

    Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is a next generation sequencing based method
    that takes advantage of reduced representation to enable high throughput
    genotyping of large numbers of individuals at a large number of SNP markers.
    The relatively straightforward, robust, and cost-effective GBS protocol is
    currently being applied in numerous species by a large number of
    researchers. Herein we describe a bioinformatics pipeline, tassel-gbs,
    designed for the efficient processing of raw GBS sequence data into SNP
    genotypes. The tassel-gbs pipeline successfully fulfills the following key
    design criteria: (1) Ability to run on the modest computing resources that
    are typically available to small breeding or ecological research programs,
    including desktop or laptop machines with only 8–16 GB of RAM, (2)
    Scalability from small to extremely large studies, where hundreds of
    thousands or even millions of SNPs can be scored in up to 100,000
    individuals (e.g., for large breeding programs or genetic surveys), and (3)
    Applicability in an accelerated breeding context, requiring rapid turnover
    from tissue collection to genotypes. Although a reference genome is
    required, the pipeline can also be run with an unfinished “pseudo-reference”
    consisting of numerous contigs. We describe the tassel-gbs pipeline in
    detail and benchmark it based upon a large scale, species wide analysis in
    maize (Zea mays), where the average error rate was reduced to 0.0042 through
    application of population genetic-based SNP filters. Overall, the GBS assay
    and the tassel-gbs pipeline provide robust tools for studying genomic
    diversity.

  abstract: >-
    Cellular responses to stimuli are rapid and continuous and yet the vast
    majority of investigations of transcriptional responses during developmental
    transitions typically use long interval time courses; limiting the available
    interpretive power. Moreover, such experiments typically focus on
    protein-coding transcripts, ignoring the important impact of long noncoding
    RNAs. We therefore evaluated coding and noncoding expression dynamics at
    unprecedented temporal resolution (6-hourly) in differentiating mouse
    embryonic stem cells and report new insight into molecular processes and
    genome organization. We present a highly resolved differentiation cascade
    that exhibits coding and noncoding transcriptional alterations,
    transcription factor network interactions and alternative splicing events,
    little of which can be resolved by long-interval developmental time-courses.
    We describe novel short lived and cycling patterns of gene expression and
    dissect temporally ordered gene expression changes in response to
    transcription factors. We elucidate patterns in gene co-expression across
    the genome, describe asynchronous transcription at bidirectional promoters
    and functionally annotate known and novel regulatory lncRNAs. These findings
    highlight the complex and dynamic molecular events underlying mammalian
    differentiation that can only be observed though a temporally resolved time
    course.

  abstract: >-
    Considerable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have amassed
    showing that the risk of developing disease in later life is dependent on
    early life conditions, mainly operating within the normative range of
    developmental exposures. This relationship reflects plastic responses made
    by the developing organism as an evolved strategy to cope with immediate or
    predicted circumstances, to maximize fitness in the context of the range of
    environments potentially faced. There is now increasing evidence, both in
    animals and humans, that such developmental plasticity is mediated in part
    by epigenetic mechanisms. However, recognition of the importance of
    developmental plasticity as an important factor in influencing later life
    health—particularly within the medical and public health communities—is low,
    and we argue that this indifference cannot be sustained in light of the
    growing understanding of developmental processes and the rapid rise in the
    prevalence of obesity and metabolic disease globally. Birth Defects Research

  abstract: >-
    In this paper, we are interested in the problem of approximating trees by
    trees with a particular self-nested structure. Self-nested trees are such
    that all their subtrees of a given height are isomorphic. We show that these
    trees present remarkable compression properties, with high compression
    rates. In order to measure how far a tree is from being a self-nested tree,
    we then study how to quantify the degree of self-nestedness of any tree. For
    this, we define a measure of the self-nestedness of a tree by constructing a
    self-nested tree that minimizes the distance of the original tree to the set
    of self-nested trees that embed the initial tree. We show that this measure
    can be computed in polynomial time and depict the corresponding algorithm.
    The distance to this nearest embedding self-nested tree (NEST) is then used
    to define compression coefficients that reflect the compressibility of a
    tree. To illustrate this approach, we then apply these notions to the
    analysis of plant branching structures. Based on a database of simulated
    theoretical plants in which different levels of noise have been introduced,
    we evaluate the method and show that the NESTs of such branching structures
    restore partly or completely the original, noiseless, branching structures.
    The whole approach is then applied to the analysis of a real plant (a rice
    panicle) whose topological structure was completely measured. We show that
    the NEST of this plant may be interpreted in biological terms and may be
    used to reveal important aspects of the plant growth.

    The genome of the japonica subspecies of rice, an important cereal and model
    monocot, was sequenced and assembled by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The
    assembled sequence covers 93% of the 420-megabase genome. Gene predictions
    on the assembled sequence suggest that the genome contains 32,000 to 50,000
    genes. Homologs of 98% of the known maize, wheat, and barley proteins are
    found in rice. Synteny and gene homology between rice and the other cereal
    genomes are extensive, whereas synteny with Arabidopsis is limited.
    Assignment of candidate rice orthologs to Arabidopsis genes is possible in
    many cases. The rice genome sequence provides a foundation for the
    improvement of cereals, our most important crops.

  abstract: >-
    Field parasitism rates of the Argentine stem weevil Listronotus bonariensis
    (Kuschel) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) by Microctonus hyperodae Loan
    (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) are known to vary according to different host
    Lolium species that also differ in ploidy. To further investigate this, a
    laboratory study was conducted to examine parasitism rates on tetraploid
    Italian L. multiflorum, diploid L. perenne and diploid hybrid L. perenne ×
    L. multiflorum; none of which were infected by Epichloë endophyte. At the
    same time, the opportunity was taken to compare the results of this study
    with observations made during extensive laboratory-based research and
    parasitoid-rearing in the 1990s using the same host plant species. This made
    it possible to determine whether there has been any change in weevil
    susceptibility to the parasitoid over a 20 year period in the presence of
    the tetraploid Italian, diploid perennial and hybrid host grasses that were
    common to both experiments. The incidence of parasitism in cages, in the
    presence of these three grasses mirrored what has recently been observed in
    the field. When caged, weevil parasitism rates in the presence of a
    tetraploid Italian ryegrass host were significantly higher (75%) than rates
    that occurred in the presence of either the diploid perennial (46%) or the
    diploid hybrid (52%) grass, which were not significantly different from each
    other. This is very different to laboratory parasitism rates in the 1990s
    when in the presence of both of the latter grasses high rates of parasitism
    (c. 75%) were recorded. These high rates are typical of those still found in
    both field and caged tetraploid Italian grasses. In contrast, the abrupt
    decline in weevil parasitism rates points to the possibility of evolved
    resistance by the weevil to the parasitoid in the diploid and hybrid
    grasses, but not so in the tetraploid. The orientation of plants in the
    laboratory cages had no significant effect on parasitism rates under any
    treatment conditions suggesting that plant architecture may not be
    contributing to the underlying mechanism resulting in different rates of
    parasitism. The evolutionary implications of what appears to be
    plant-mediated resistance of L. bonariensis to parasitism by M. hyperodae
    are discussed.

  abstract: >-
    The Argentine stem weevil (Listronotus bonariensis) was an economically
    important pest in New Zealand pastures until the release of the parasitoid
    Microctonus hyperodae. This contribution uses historical data to investigate
    the regulation of the pest populations prior to, and somewhat during, the
    establishment of this parasitoid in dryland Canterbury, New Zealand. Thus, a
    significant goal of this study is to provide an L. bonariensis population
    dynamics baseline for any future work that aims to analyse the full effects
    of M. hyperodae on the weevil, now that equilibrium with the weevil host has
    been reached.The population dynamics of L. bonariensis, based on a
    life-table approach, were investigated using data collected regularly for
    eight years from populations in Canterbury, New Zealand. The key factor
    affecting end-of-season L. bonariensis density was found to be variation in
    second generation fourth instar prepupal and pupal mortality. This may have
    been caused by arrested development and ongoing mortality resulting from the
    onset of cooler autumnal conditions.A compensatory response was found in
    recruitment to the second summer weevil generation, whereby the realised
    fecundity of the emergent first summer generation of weevils was found to be
    negatively related to the density of adult weevils per ryegrass tiller. This
    is the first time that this has been found via long-term population analysis
    of L. bonariensis, although indications of this have been found elsewhere in
    caging, pot and small plot experiments.In this study, the effect of the
    parasitoid biocontrol agent Microctonus hyperodae on L. bonariensis
    population dynamics was unclear, as the analysis covered a period when the
    parasitoid Microctonus hyperodae was introduced and still establishing. It
    does, however, raise important questions for future analysis in terms of the
    interaction between parasitism and unrealised fecundity.The results in this
    contribution also highlighted regional differences. Overwintering mortality
    of adult weevils in Canterbury was constant between years, whilst earlier
    studies in the North Island Waikato region indicated this mortality was
    density dependent. In addition, the availability of tillers in
    endophyte-free ryegrass pastures in Canterbury had no influence on egg and
    early-instar larval survival, which contrasts with the finding from
    endophytic Waikato pastures.

    Classical biological control of insects has a long history of success, with
    high benefit–cost ratios. However, most attempts to introduce a biological
    control agent have been unsuccessful, largely because the agent does not
    establish in the new environment. This perspectives paper discusses the
    possibility that even successful biological control may eventually fail,
    although records show that this is far from a common event. A documented
    example of eventual biological control failure is discussed and the prospect
    for future failures analyzed. Part of this analysis is based on an
    introduced weevil pest in New Zealand and its successful parasitoid
    biological control agent. The potential fragility of this host–parasitoid
    relationship is considered, as well as why it may indeed be starting to show
    signs of instability; this is particularly from the point of view of New
    Zealand’s often species-poor agricultural ecosystems.

    We show that site-specific recombination can be used to engineer chromosome
    rearrangements in Drosophila melanogaster. The FLP site-specific recombinase
    acts on chromosomal target sites located within specially constructed P
    elements to provide an easy screen for the recovery of rearrangements with
    breakpoints that can be chosen in advance. Paracentric and pericentric
    inversions are easily recovered when two elements lie in the same chromosome
    in opposite orientation. These inversions are readily reversible.
    Duplications and deficiencies can be recovered by recombination between two
    elements that lie in the same orientation on the same chromosome or on
    homologues. We observe that the frequency of recombination between FRTs at
    ectopic locations decreases as the distance that separates those FRTs
    increases. We also describe methods to determine the absolute orientation of
    these P elements within the chromosome. The ability to produce chromosome
    rearrangements precisely between preselected sites provides a powerful new
    tool for investigations into the relationships between chromosome arrange
    ment, structure, and function.

    While many short read assemblers attempt to simplify the de Brujin graph by
    identifying and resolving variant-induced bubbles to produce a haploid
    mosaic result, this approach is only viable when variants are relatively
    rare and the bubbles are well defined in a graph context. We observed that
    diploid genomes with very high levels of heterozygosity fail to display
    well-resolved bubble structures in a typical assembly graph and thus result
    in highly fragmented and incomplete assemblies. Here we present an
    enhancement of Meraculous2 algorithm, called Meraculous-2D, which preserves
    haplotypes across variant sites and generates accurate assembly of highly
    heterozygous diploid genomes. Preserving and taking advantage of the allelic
    variation throughout the assembly process allows reconstructing both
    haplomes at once, without the need to pick arbitrary paths through bubble
    structures. We also enhanced the original diploidy resolution method of
    Meraculous2 to maintain and report phased haplotype variant information.

    Floral organs, whose identity is determined by specific combinations of
    homeotic genes, originate from a group of undifferentiated cells called the
    floral meristem. In Arabidopsis, the homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) terminates
    meristem activity and promotes development of stamens and carpels. To
    understand the program of gene expression activated by AG, we followed
    genome-wide expression during early stamen and carpel development. The AG
    target genes included most genes for which mutant screens revealed a
    function downstream of AG. Novel targets were validated by in situ
    hybridisation and binding to AG in vitro and in vivo. Transcription factors
    formed a large fraction of AG targets, suggesting that during early
    organogenesis, much of the genetic program is concerned with elaborating
    gene expression patterns. The results also suggest that AG and other
    homeotic proteins with which it interacts (SEPALLATA3, APETALA3, PISTILLATA)
    are coordinately regulated in a positive-feedback loop to maintain their own
    expression, and that AG activates biosynthesis of gibberellin, which has
    been proposed to promote the shift from meristem identity to
    differentiation.

    The gain, loss or modification of morphological traits is generally
    associated with changes in gene regulation during development. However, the
    molecular bases underlying these evolutionary changes have remained elusive.
    Here we identify one of the molecular mechanisms that contributes to the
    evolutionary gain of a male-specific wing pigmentation spot in Drosophila
    biarmipes, a species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster. We show
    that the evolution of this spot involved modifications of an ancestral
    cis-regulatory element of the yellow pigmentation gene. This element has
    gained multiple binding sites for transcription factors that are deeply
    conserved components of the regulatory landscape controlling wing
    development, including the selector protein Engrailed. The evolutionary
    stability of components of regulatory landscapes, which can be co-opted by
    chance mutations in cis-regulatory elements, might explain the repeated
    evolution of similar morphological patterns, such as wing pigmentation
    patterns in flies.

  abstract: >-
    Ends-in and ends-out refer to the two arrangements of donor DNA that can be
    used for gene targeting. Both have been used for targeted mutagenesis, but
    require donors of differing design. Ends-out targeting is more frequently
    used in mice and yeast because it gives a straightforward route to replace
    or delete a target locus. Although ends-in targeting has been successful in
    Drosophiia, an attempt at ends-out targeting failed. To test whether
    ends-out targeting could be used in Drosophila, we applied two strategies
    for ends-out gene replacement at the endogenous yellow (y) locus in
    Drosophila. First, a mutant allele was rescued by replacement with an 8-kb
    y(+) DNA fragment at a rate of approximate to1/800 gametes. Second, a
    wild-type gene was disrupted by the insertion of a marker gene in exon 1 at
    a rate of approximate to1/380 gametes. The I-SceI endonuclease component
    alone is not sufficient for targeting: the FLP recombinase is also needed to
    generate the extrachromosomal donor. When both components are used we find
    that ends-out targeting can be approximately as efficient as ends-in
    targeting, and is likely to be generally useful for Drosophila gene
    targeting.

    We map 114 gene gains and 74 gene losses in the P450 gene family across the
    phylogeny of 12 Drosophila species by examining the congruence of gene trees
    and species trees. Although the number of P450 genes varies from 74 to 94 in
    the species examined, we infer that there were at least 77 P450 genes in the
    ancestral Drosophila genome. One of the most striking observations in the
    data set is the elevated loss of P450 genes in the Drosophila sechellia
    lineage. The gain and loss events are not evenly distributed among the P450
    genes—with 30 genes showing no gene gains or losses whereas others show as
    many as 20 copy number changes among the species examined. The P450 gene
    clades showing the fewest number of gene gain and loss events tend to be
    those evolving with the most purifying selection acting on the protein
    sequences, although there are exceptions, such as the rapid rate of amino
    acid replacement observed in the single copy phantom (Cyp306a1) gene. Within
    D. melanogaster, we observe gene copy number polymorphism in ten P450 genes
    including multiple cases of interparalog chimeras. Nonallelic homologous
    recombination (NAHR) has been associated with deleterious mutations in
    humans, but here we provide a second possible example of an NAHR event in
    insect P450s being adaptive. Specifically, we find that a polymorphic
    Cyp12a4/Cyp12a5 chimera correlates with resistance to an insecticide.
    Although we observe such interparalog exchange in our within-species data
    sets, we have little evidence of it between species, raising the possibility
    that such events may occur more frequently than appreciated but are masked
    by subsequent sequence change.

    The number of sequenced plant genomes and associated genomic resources is
    growing rapidly with the advent of both an increased focus on plant genomics
    from funding agencies, and the application of inexpensive next generation
    sequencing. To interact with this increasing body of data, we have developed
    Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net), a comparative hub for plant genome and
    gene family data and analysis. Phytozome provides a view of the evolutionary
    history of every plant gene at the level of sequence, gene structure, gene
    family and genome organization, while at the same time providing access to
    the sequences and functional annotations of a growing number (currently 25)
    of complete plant genomes, including all the land plants and selected algae
    sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute, as well as selected species
    sequenced elsewhere. Through a comprehensive plant genome database and web
    portal, these data and analyses are available to the broader plant science
    research community, providing powerful comparative genomics tools that help
    to link model systems with other plants of economic and ecological
    importance.

    A central unanswered question in stem cell biology, both in plants and in
    animals, is how the spatial organization of stem cell niches are maintained
    as cells move through them. We address this question for the shoot apical
    meristem (SAM) which harbors pluripotent stem cells responsible for growth
    of above-ground tissues in flowering plants. We find that localized
    perception of the plant hormone cytokinin establishes a spatial domain in
    which cell fate is respecified through induction of the master regulator
    WUSCHEL as cells are displaced during growth. Cytokinin-induced WUSCHEL
    expression occurs through both CLAVATA-dependent and CLAVATA-independent
    pathways. Computational analysis shows that feedback between cytokinin
    response and genetic regulators predicts their relative patterning, which we
    confirm experimentally. Our results also may explain how increasing
    cytokinin concentration leads to the first steps in reestablishing the shoot
    stem cell niche in vitro.

    The insect order Hemiptera, one of the best-studied insect lineages with
    respect to bacterial symbioses, still contains major branches that lack
    comprehensive characterization of associated bacterial symbionts. The
    Pyrrhocoroidea (Largidae [220 species] and Pyrrhocoridae [∼300 species]) is
    a clade of the hemipteran infraorder Pentatomomorpha. Studies on bacterial
    symbionts of this group have focused on members of Pyrrhocoridae, but recent
    examination of species of two genera of Largidae demonstrated divergent
    symbiotic complexes in these putative sister families. We surveyed the
    associated bacterial diversity of this group using paired-end Illumina
    sequencing and targeted Sanger sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons of
    30 pyrrhocoroid taxa, including 17 species of Largidae, in order to
    determine bacterial associates and the similarity of associated microbial
    communities among species. We also used molecular data (4,800 bp in 5 loci,
    for 57 ingroup and 12 outgroup taxa) to infer a phylogeny of the host
    superfamily, in order to trace the evolution of symbiotic complexes among
    Pentatomomorpha species. We undertook multiple lines of investigation (i.e.,
    experimental rearing, fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy, and
    phylogenetic and coevolutionary analyses) to elucidate potential
    transmission routes for largid symbionts. We found a prevalent and specific
    association of Largidae with Burkholderia strains of the plant-associated
    beneficial and environmental clade, housed in midgut tubules. As in other
    distantly related Heteroptera, symbiotic bacteria seem to be acquired from
    the environment every generation. We review the current understanding of
    symbiotic complexes within Pentatomomorpha and discuss means to further
    investigate the evolution and function of these symbioses.

    IMPORTANCE Obligate symbioses with bacteria are common in insects,
    particularly Hemiptera, in which various forms of symbiosis occur. However,
    knowledge regarding symbionts remains incomplete for major hemipteran
    lineages. Thus, an accurate understanding of how these partnerships evolved
    and changed over millions of years is not yet achievable. We contribute to
    our understanding of the evolution of symbiotic complexes in Hemiptera by
    characterizing bacterial associates of Pyrrhocoroidea, focusing on the
    family Largidae. Members of Largidae are associated with specific symbiotic
    Burkholderia strains from a different clade than Burkholderia symbionts in
    other Burkholderia-associated Hemiptera. Evidence suggests that species of
    Largidae reacquire specific symbiotic bacteria from the environment every
    generation, which is a rare strategy for insects, with potentially volatile
    evolutionary ramifications, but one that must have persisted in Largidae and

    The substrate recognition regions in cytochrome P450 family 2 (CYP2)
    proteins were inferred by group-to-group alignment of CYP2 sequences and
    those of bacterial P450s, including Pseudomonas putida P450 101A (P450cam),
    whose substrate-binding residues have been definitely identified by x-ray
    crystallography of a substrate-bound form (Poulos T. L., Finzel, B. C., and
    Howard, A. J. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 195, 687-700). The six putative substrate
    recognition sites, SRSs, thus identified are dispersively located along the
    primary structure and constitute about 16% of the total residues. All the
    reported point mutations and chimeric fragments that significantly affect
    the substrate specificities of the parental CYP2 enzymes fell within or
    overlapped some of the six SRSs. Analysis of nucleotide substitution
    patterns in closely related members in four subfamilies, CYP2A, 2B, 2C, and
    2D, consistently indicated that the SRSs have accumulated more nonsynonymous
    (amino acid-changing) substitutions than the rest of the sequence. This
    observation supports the idea that diversification of duplicate genes of
    drug-metabolizing P450s occurs primarily in substrate recognition regions to
    cope with an increasing number of foreign compounds.

    Germline mutations in Ras pathway components are associated with a large
    class of human developmental abnormalities, known as RASopathies, that are
    characterized by a range of structural and functional phenotypes, including
    cardiac defects and neurocognitive delays. Although it is generally believed
    that RASopathies are caused by altered levels of pathway activation, the
    signaling changes in developing tissues remain largely unknown. We used
    assays with spatiotemporal resolution in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)
    and Danio rerio (zebrafish) to quantify signaling changes caused by
    mutations in MAP2K1 (encoding MEK), a core component of the Ras pathway that
    is mutated in both RASopathies and cancers in humans. Surprisingly, we
    discovered that intrinsically active MEK variants can both increase and
    reduce the levels of pathway activation in vivo. The sign of the effect
    depends on cellular context, implying that some of the emerging phenotypes
    in RASopathies may be caused by increased, as well as attenuated, levels of
    Ras signaling.

    Phenotypic plasticity is the nongenic variation in phenotype due to
    environmental factors. It is a common phenomenon in the animal kingdom that
    is not well understood at the molecular level. A tenable form of phenotypic
    plasticity for molecular research is polyphenism, which is an extreme form
    of phenotypic plasticity that results in discrete, alternative morphs.
    Epigenetic mechanisms have been hypothesized as the molecular regulators of
    polyphenism, in particular DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. The pea
    aphid exhibits multiple polyphenisms including winged and wingless females
    during summer (wing polyphenism) and asexual and sexual morphs during summer
    and fall, respectively (reproductive polyphenism). The aphid is ideally
    situated for research into the molecular basis of polyphenism, with a
    sequenced genome and multiple transcriptomic studies that have begun
    identifying key molecular regulators of these two polyphenisms. The aphid
    also possesses the genes necessary for DNA methylation and chromatin
    remodeling. The pea aphid system is thus primed for future research into the
    epigenetic regulation of polyphenisms.

    A recent slew of ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium
    publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put
    forward the idea that more than 80% of the human genome is functional. This
    claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction
    of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection
    is less than 10%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological
    function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies
    that at least 80 - 10 = 70% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to
    deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these
    "functional" regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be
    deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means,
    chiefly by employing the seldom used "causal role" definition of biological
    function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical
    properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as "affirming the
    consequent," by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between "junk
    DNA" and "garbage DNA," by using analytical methods that yield biased errors
    and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity
    over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than
    the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and
    methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost
    every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by
    one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many
    textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may
    well have to be rewritten.

    Objective To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying
    the pattern of citations among papers stating it.Design A complete citation
    network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English literature papers
    addressing the belief that beta amyloid, a protein accumulated in the brain
    in Alzheimer's disease, is produced by and injures skeletal muscle of
    patients with inclusion body myositis. Social network theory and graph
    theory were used to analyse this network.Main outcome measures Citation
    bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining
    authority.Results The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations
    addressing the belief, with 220 553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded
    authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or
    weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief
    system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention
    such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone.
    Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National
    Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act
    showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for
    funding.Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a
    powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use
    that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to
    generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims.
    Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify
    the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of
    social citation.

    Insecticide resistance is a paradigm of microevolution, and insecticides are
    responsible for the strongest cases of recent selection in the genome of
    Drosophila melanogaster. Here we use a naïve population and a novel
    insecticide class to examine the ab initio genetic architecture of a
    potential selective response. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
    chlorantraniliprole susceptibility reveal variation in a gene of major
    effect, Stretchin Myosin light chain kinase (Strn-Mlck), which we validate
    with linkage mapping and transgenic manipulation of gene expression. We
    propose that allelic variation in Strn-Mlck alters sensitivity to the
    calcium depletion attributable to chlorantraniliprole’s mode of action. GWAS
    also reveal a network of genes involved in neuromuscular biology. In
    contrast, phenotype to transcriptome associations identify differences in
    constitutive levels of multiple transcripts regulated by cnc, the homolog of
    mammalian Nrf2. This suggests that genetic variation acts in trans to
    regulate multiple metabolic enzymes in this pathway. The most outstanding
    association is with the transcription level of Cyp12d1 which is also
    affected in cis by copy number variation. Transgenic overexpression of
    Cyp12d1 reduces susceptibility to both chlorantraniliprole and the closely
    related insecticide cyantraniliprole. This systems genetics study reveals
    multiple allelic variants segregating at intermediate frequency in a
    population that is completely naïve to this new insecticide chemistry and it
    foreshadows a selective response among natural populations to these
    chemicals.

    near-complete or draft versions of the genome sequence of several
    well-studied, multicellular organisms — most notably, the human. As well as
    providing data of fundamental biological significance, these landmark
    accomplishments have yielded important strategic insights that are guiding

    Ageing is associated with an increased onset of cancer. Understanding the
    molecular mechanisms that underlie the age dependency of cancer will have
    important implications for preventing and treating this pathology. The
    signalling pathway connecting insulin and FOXO transcription factors
    provides the most compelling example for a conserved genetic pathway at the
    interface between ageing and cancer. FOXO transcription factors (FOXO)
    promote longevity and tumour suppression. FOXO transcription factors are
    directly phosphorylated in response to insulin/growth factor signalling by
    the protein kinase Akt, thereby causing their sequestration in the
    cytoplasm. In the absence of insulin/growth factors, FOXO factors
    translocate to the nucleus where they trigger a range of cellular responses,
    including resistance to oxidative stress, a phenotype highly coupled with
    lifespan extension. FOXO factors integrate stress stimuli via
    phosphorylation, acetylation and mono-ubiquitination of a series of
    regulatory sites. Understanding how FOXO proteins integrate environmental
    conditions to control specific gene expression programmes will be pivotal in
    identifying ways to slow the onset of cancer in ageing individuals.

    The enzyme catalase protects aerobic organisms from oxygen-free radical
    damage by converting hydrogen peroxide to molecular oxygen and water before
    it can decompose to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Hydroxyl
    radicals are the most deleterious of the activated oxygen intermediates
    found in aerobic organisms. If formed, they can react with biological
    molecules in their proximity; the ensuing damage has been implicated in the
    increasing risk of disease and death associated with aging. To study further
    the regulation and role of catalase we have undertaken a molecular
    characterization of the Drosophila catalase gene and two potentially
    acatalasemic alleles. We have demonstrated that a previously existing
    allele, Cat(n4), likely contains a null mutation, a mutation which blocks
    normal translation of the encoded mRNA. The Cat(n1) mutation appears to
    cause a significant change in the protein sequence; however, it is unclear
    why this change leads to a nonfunctioning protein. Viability of these
    acatalasemic flies can be restored by transformation with the wild-type
    catalase gene; hence, we conclude that the lethality of these genotypes is
    due solely to the lack of catalase. The availability of flies with
    transformed catalase genes has allowed us to address the effect of catalase
    levels on aging in Drosophila. Though lack of catalase activity caused
    decreased viability and life span, increasing catalase activity above
    wild-type levels had no effect on normal life span.

    Multicellular animals match costly activities, such as growth and
    reproduction, to the environment through nutrient-sensing pathways. The
    insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway plays key roles in growth, metabolism,
    stress resistance, reproduction, and longevity in diverse organisms
    including mammals. Invertebrate genomes often contain multiple genes
    encoding insulin-like ligands, including seven Drosophila insulin-like
    peptides (DILPs). We investigated the evolution, diversification,
    redundancy, and functions of the DILPs, combining evolutionary analysis,
    based on the completed genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species, and
    functional analysis, based on newly-generated knock-out mutations for all 7
    dilp genes in D. melanogaster. Diversification of the 7 DILPs preceded
    diversification of Drosophila species, with stable gene diversification and
    family membership, suggesting stabilising selection for gene function. Gene
    knock-outs demonstrated both synergy and compensation of expression between
    different DILPs, notably with DILP3 required for normal expression of DILPs
    2 and 5 in brain neurosecretory cells and expression of DILP6 in the fat
    body compensating for loss of brain DILPs. Loss of DILP2 increased lifespan
    and loss of DILP6 reduced growth, while loss of DILP7 did not affect
    fertility, contrary to its proposed role as a Drosophila relaxin.
    Importantly, loss of DILPs produced in the brain greatly extended lifespan
    but only in the presence of the endosymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia,
    demonstrating a specific interaction between IIS and Wolbachia in lifespan
    regulation. Furthermore, loss of brain DILPs blocked the responses of
    lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction (DR) and the DR response of
    these mutants suggests that IIS extends lifespan through mechanisms that
    both overlap with those of DR and through additional mechanisms that are
    independent of those at work in DR. Evolutionary conservation has thus been
    accompanied by synergy, redundancy, and functional differentiation between
    DILPs, and these features may themselves be of evolutionary advantage.

    staple food source, is thus essential. These questions have been a point of
    nearly continuous research in both archaeology and genetics, and new
    information has continually come to light as theory, data acquisition, and
    analytical techniques have advanced over time. Here, we review the broad
    history of our scientific understanding of the rice domestication process
    from both an archaeological and genetic perspective and examine in detail
    the information that has come to light in both of these fields in the last
    10 y. Current findings from genetics and archaeology are consistent with the
    domestication of O. sativa japonica in the Yangtze River valley of southern
    China. Interestingly, although it appears rice was cultivated in the area by
    as early 8000 BP, the key domestication trait of nonshattering was not fixed
    for another 1,000 y or perhaps longer. Rice was also cultivated in India as
    early as 5000 BP, but the domesticated indica subspecies currently appears
    to be a product of the introgression of favorable alleles from japonica.
    These findings are reshaping our understanding of rice domestication and
    also have implications for understanding the complex evolutionary process of
    plant domestication.

    Scientific research funding is allocated largely through a system of
    soliciting and ranking competitive grant proposals. In these competitions,
    the proposals themselves are not the deliverables that the funder seeks, but
    instead are used by the funder to screen for the most promising research
    ideas. Consequently, some of the funding program's impact on science is
    squandered because applying researchers must spend time writing proposals
    instead of doing science. To what extent does the community's aggregate
    investment in proposal preparation negate the scientific impact of the
    funding program? Are there alternative mechanisms for awarding funds that
    advance science more efficiently? We use the economic theory of contests to
    analyze how efficiently grant proposal competitions advance science, and
    compare them with recently proposed, partially randomized alternatives such
    as lotteries. We find that the effort researchers waste in writing proposals
    may be comparable to the total scientific value of the research that the
    funding supports, especially when only a few proposals can be funded.
    Moreover, when professional pressures motivate investigators to seek funding
    for reasons that extend beyond the value of the proposed science (e.g.,
    promotion, prestige), the entire program can actually hamper scientific
    progress when the number of awards is small. We suggest that lost efficiency
    may be restored either by partial lotteries for funding or by funding
    researchers based on past scientific success instead of proposals for future
    work.

    Objective To determine whether the author's 20.9 lb (9.5 kg) carbon frame
    bicycle reduced commuting time compared with his 29.75 lb (13.5 kg) steel
    frame bicycle.Design Randomised trial.Setting Sheffield and Chesterfield,
    United Kingdom, between mid-January 2010 and mid-July 2010.Participants One
    consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care.Main outcome measure Total time
    to complete the 27 mile (43.5 kilometre) journey from Sheffield to
    Chesterfield Royal Hospital and back.Results The total distance travelled on
    the steel frame bicycle during the study period was 809 miles (1302 km) and
    on the carbon frame bicycle was 711 miles (1144 km). The difference in the
    mean journey time between the steel and carbon bicycles was 00: 00: 32
    (hr:min:sec; 95% CI -00:03:34 to 00:02:30; P=0.72).Conclusions A lighter
    bicycle did not lead to a detectable difference in commuting time. Cyclists
    may find it more cost effective to reduce their own weight rather than to
    purchase a lighter bicycle.

    We tested the hypothesis that queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) causes
    changes in gene expression in the brain of the adult worker honey bee, and
    that these changes can be correlated to the downstream behavioral responses
    induced by QMP. In support of the first hypothesis, cage experiments
    revealed that QMP transiently regulated expression of several hundred genes
    and chronically regulated the expression of 19 genes. Several of these genes
    were also affected by QMP in experiments with bee colonies in the field,
    demonstrating robust gene regulation by pheromone. To evaluate the second
    hypothesis, we focused on one function of QMP: delaying the transition from
    working in the hive (e.g., brood care, or “nursing”) to foraging. We
    compared the list of QMP-regulated genes with the lists of genes
    differentially regulated in nurse and forager brains generated in a separate
    study. QMP consistently activated “nursing genes” and repressed “foraging
    genes,” suggesting that QMP may delay behavioral maturation by regulating
    genes in the brain that produce these behavioral states. We also report here
    on an ortholog of the Drosophila transcription factor kruppel homolog 1 that
    was strongly regulated by QMP, especially in the mushroom bodies of the bee
    brain. These results demonstrate chronic gene regulation by a primer
    pheromone and illustrate the potential of genomics to trace the actions of a
    pheromone from perception to action, and thereby provide insights into how
    pheromones regulate social life.

  abstract: >-
    The AN02 strain of Helicoverpa armigera from eastern Australia exhibits
    50-fold, PBO-suppressible resistance to the pyrethroid insecticide
    fenvalerate. The semidominant resistance gene RFen1 was previously mapped to
    AFLP Linkage Group 13. In evaluating the cytochrome P450 genes CYP6B7,
    CYP6B6, and CYP6B2 as candidates for RFen1, we found that they occur in a
    tandem array in the genome, next to the gene encoding the para-type sodium
    channel; the target of pyrethroid insecticides. We mapped these genes to
    AFLP Linkage Group 14, thus rejecting mutations within the P450 cluster or
    para as candidates for RFen1. RFen1 genotypes produced slightly different
    mRNA levels of the three P450s, but the differences were too small to
    convincingly account for resistance. We conclude that even if one or more of
    these P450s metabolize fenvalerate, they are unlikely to be responsible for
    the resistance in AN02.

  abstract: >-
    A wide range of morphological and physiological traits have changed between
    cultivated rice Oryza sativa and wild rice Oryza rufipogon under
    domestication. Here, we report cloning of the An-2 gene, encoding the Lonely
    Guy Like protein 6 (OsLOGL6), which catalyzes the final step of cytokinin
    synthesis in O.rufipogon. The near-isogenic line harboring a wild allele of
    An-2 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai 4 shows that
    An-2 promotes awn elongation by enhancing cell division, but decreases grain
    production by reducing grains per panicle and tillers per plant. We reveal
    that a genetic variation in the An-2 locus has a large impact on reducing
    awn length and increasing tiller and grain numbers in domesticated rice.
    Analysis of gene expression patterns suggests that An-1 regulates the
    formation of awn primordial, and An-2 promotes awn elongation. Nucleotide
    diversity of the An-2 locus in cultivated rice was found to be significantly
    reduced compared with that of wild rice, suggesting that the An-2 locus was
    subjected to artificial selection. We therefore propose that the selection
    of genetic variation in An-2 was due to reduced awn length and increased
    grain yield in cultivated rice.

    Cytochrome P-450 (P-450) 3A4 is the most abundant P-450 expressed in human
    liver and small intestine. P-450 3A4 contributes to the metabolism of
    approximately half the drugs in use today, and variations in its catalytic
    activity are important in issues of bioavailability and drug-drug
    interactions. The gene is known to be inducible by barbiturates,
    glucocorticoids, and rifampicin in humans and in isolated hepatocytes,
    although the mechanism remains unclear. The 5'-untranslated region includes
    putative basal transcription element, hepatocyte nuclear factor, p53, AP-3,
    glucocorticoid regulatory element, pregnane X receptor, and estrogen
    receptor element sequences. Recently, the GRE element has been shown to act
    in a classic glucocorticoid response. Several issues remain to be resolved
    regarding the catalytic activity of the P-450 3A4 protein, including
    rate-limiting steps and the need for cytochrome b5, divalent cations, and
    acidic phospholipid systems for optimal activity. Another issue involves the
    basis of the homotropic and heterotropic cooperativity seen with the enzyme.
    The in vivo significance of these findings remains to be further
    established. In addition to more basic studies on P-450 3A4, several areas
    of practical interest to the pharmaceutical industry require development.

    The field of cytochrome P450 (P450) research has developed considerably over
    the past 20 years, and many important papers on the roles of P450s in
    chemical toxicology have appeared in Chemical Research in Toxicology. Today,
    our basic understanding of many of the human P450s is relatively
    well-established, in terms of the details of the individual genes,
    sequences, and basic catalytic mechanisms. Crystal structures of several of
    the major human P450s are now in hand. The animal P450s are still important
    in the context of metabolism and safety testing. Many well-defined examples
    exist for roles of P450s in decreasing the adverse effects of drugs through
    biotransformation, and an equally interesting field of investigation is the
    bioactivation of chemicals, including drugs. Unresolved problems include the
    characterization of the minor "orphan" P450s, ligand cooperativity and
    kinetic complexity of several P450s, the prediction of metabolism, the
    overall contribution of bioactivation to drug idiosyncratic problems, the
    extrapolation of animal test results to humans in drug development, and the
    contribution of genetic variation in human P450s to cancer incidence.

    The human genome has now been established to contain 57 cytochrome P450
    genes. The proteins can be grouped into categories of types of substrates,
    including sterols, fatty acids, eicosanoids, and fat-soluble vitamins. Some
    P450s have also been demonstrated to have significant roles in the
    metabolism of drugs and chemicals. In addition to these, at least 13 can be
    considered to still be without apparent function with endogenous or
    xenobiotic substrates. The current list includes P450s 2A7, 2S1, 2U1, 2W1,
    3A43, 4A22, 4F11, 4F22, 4V2, 4X1, 4Z1, 20A1, and 27C1. Limited information
    is available about the sites of mRNA expression of some of these orphans.
    Some strategies for characterization are discussed.

  abstract: "The longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, feeds upon a wide range of bird and mammalian hosts. Mammalian hosts include cattle, deer, sheep, goats, humans, and horses. This tick is known to transmit a number of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases, and was the vector of a recent serious outbreak of oriental theileriosis in New Zealand. A New Zealand-USA consortium was established to sequence, assemble, and annotate the genome of this tick, using ticks obtained from New Zealand's North Island. In New Zealand, the tick is considered exclusively parthenogenetic and this trait was deemed useful for genome assembly. Very high molecular weight genomic DNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq4000 and the long-read Pac Bio Sequel platforms. Twenty-eight SMRT cells produced a total of 21.3 million reads which were assembled with Canu on a reserved supercomputer node with access to 12 TB of RAM, running continuously for over 24 days. The final assembly dataset consisted of 34,211 contigs with an average contig length of 215,205\_bp. The quality of the annotated genome was assessed by BUSCO analysis, an approach that provides quantitative measures for the quality of an assembled genome. Over 95% of the BUSCO gene set was found in the assembled genome. Only 48 of the 1066 BUSCO genes were missing and only 9 were present in a fragmented condition. The raw sequencing reads and the assembled contigs/scaffolds are archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information."

    Ecdysteroids are steroid hormones, which coordinate major developmental
    transitions in insects. Both the rises and falls in circulating levels of
    active hormones are important for coordinating molting and metamorphosis,
    making both ecdysteroid biosynthesis and inactivation of physiological
    relevance. We demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster Cyp18a1 encodes a
    cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) with 26-hydroxylase activity, a prominent step
    in ecdysteroid catabolism. A clear ortholog of Cyp18a1 exists in most
    insects and crustaceans. When Cyp18a1 is transfected in Drosophila S2 cells,
    extensive conversion of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) into 20-hydroxyecdysonoic
    acid is observed. This is a multi-step process, which involves the formation
    of 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone as an intermediate. In Drosophila larvae, Cyp18a1
    is expressed in many target tissues of 20E. We examined the consequences of
    Cyp18a1 inactivation on Drosophila development. Null alleles generated by
    excision of a P element and RNAi knockdown of Cyp18a1 both result in pupal
    lethality, possibly as a consequence of impaired ecdysteroid degradation.
    Our data suggest that the inactivation of 20E is essential for proper
    development and that CYP18A1 is a key enzyme in this process.

    Transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in the transcriptional
    regulation of functional genes, and are involved in diverse physiological
    processes in living organisms. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a
    simple and easily manipulated organismal model, has been extensively applied
    to study the biological functions of TFs and their related transcriptional
    regulation mechanisms. It is noteworthy that with the development of genetic
    tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and the next-generation genome sequencing
    techniques in recent years, identification and dissection the complex
    genetic regulatory networks of TFs have also made great progress in other
    insects beyond Drosophila. However, unfortunately, there is no comprehensive
    review that systematically summarizes the structures and biological
    functions of TFs in both model and non-model insects. Here, we spend
    extensive effort in collecting vast related studies, and attempt to provide
    an impartial overview of the progress of the structure and biological
    functions of current documented TFs in insects, as well as the classical and
    emerging research methods for studying their regulatory functions.
    Consequently, considering the importance of versatile TFs in orchestrating
    diverse insect physiological processes, this review will assist a growing
    number of entomologists to interrogate this understudied field, and to
    propel the progress of their contributions to pest control and even human
    health.

    Studies were performed to identify the microsomal enzyme that
    24-hydroxylates vitamin D, whether 25-hydroxylation occurs, and structure
    function of the enzyme. Sixteen hepatic recombinant microsomal cytochrome
    P450 enzymes expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells were screened
    for 24-hydroxylase activity. CYP3A4, a vitamin D-25-hydroxylase, and CYP1A1
    had the highest 24-hydroxylase activity with 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D-2
    (1alphaOHD(2)) as substrate. The ratio of rates of 24-hydroxylation of
    1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (1alphaOHD(3)), 1alphaOHD(2), and vitamin D-2 by
    CYP3A4 was 3.6/2.8/1.0. Structures of 24-hydroxyvitamin D-2,
    1,24(S)-dihydroxyvitamin D-2, and 1,24-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 were confirmed
    by HPLC and gas chromatography retention time and mass spectroscopy. In
    characterized human liver microsomes, 24-hydroxylation of 1alphaOHD(2) by
    CYP3A4 correlated significantly with 6beta-hydroxylation of testosterone, a
    marker of CYP3A4 activity. 24-Hydroxylase activity in recombinant CYP3A4 and
    pooled human liver microsomes showed dose-dependent inhibition by
    ketoconazole, troleandomycin, alpha-naphthoflavone, and isoniazid, known
    inhibitors of CYP3A4. Rates of 24- and 25-hydroxylation of 1alphaOHD(2) and
    1alphaOHD(3) were determined in recombinant wild-type CYP3A4 and
    site-directed mutants and naturally occurring variants expressed in
    Escherichia coli. Substitution of residues showed the most prominent
    alterations of function at residues 119, 120,301, 305, and 479. Thus, CYP3A4
    is both a 24- and 25-hydroxylase for vitamin D-2, 1alphaOHD(2), and
    1alphaOHD(3).

    A number of the seminal biological control texts such as Sweetman (1936),
    DeBach (1964), Huffaker (1971), Hagen and Franz (1973) and DeBach and Rosen
    (1974) document successful examples and track the overall development of
    biological control. Other accounts exist of specific episodes, Dod?s (1940)
    ‘The Biological Campaign Against Prickly-Pear’, for example. The most recent
    history available is that of Van Driesche and Bellows (1996). The aim of
    this chapter is not to reproduce or summarise such comprehensive accounts,
    but rather to propose a chronological framework in which to view the
    development of various methodological approaches in biological control and
    to consider how empirical and theoretical inputs have influenced its
    practice.

    Lipid metabolism is essential for growth and generates much of the energy
    needed during periods of starvation. In Drosophila, fasting larvae release
    large quantities of lipid from the fat body but it is unclear how and where
    this is processed. Here we identify the oenocyte as the principal cell type
    accumulating lipid droplets during starvation. Tissue-specific manipulations
    of the Slimfast amino-acid channel, the Lsd2 fat-storage regulator and the
    Brummer lipase indicate that oenocytes act downstream of the fat body. In
    turn, oenocytes are required for depleting stored lipid from the fat body
    during fasting. Hence, lipid-metabolic coupling between the fat body and
    oenocytes is bidirectional. When food is plentiful, oenocytes have critical
    roles in regulating growth, development and feeding behaviour. In addition,
    they specifically express many different lipid-metabolizing proteins,
    including Cyp4g1, an omega-hydroxylase regulating triacylglycerol
    composition. These findings provide evidence that some lipid-processing
    functions of the mammalian liver are performed in insects by oenocytes.

  abstract: >-
    Eukaryotic P450 proteins are membrane proteins found predominantly in the
    endoplasmic reticulum. In vertebrates, several biosynthetic P450s are found
    in mitochondria as well. We cloned three putative insect mitochondrial P450s
    from larval house fly cDNA. These P450s are members of a new P450 family,
    CYP12. The CYP12 proteins are most closely related to the mammalian
    mitochondrial P450 of the CYP11, CYP24, and CYP27 families. The most
    abundant cDNA, CYP12A1, was expressed inEscherichia coliand purified.
    NADPH-dependent reduction of CYP12A1 was rapid and efficient with the bovine
    mitochondrial proteins adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin as electron
    transfer partners. In contrast, house fly microsomal NADPH cytochrome P450
    reductase reduced CYP12A1 only poorly. In a reconstituted system with the
    bovine mitochondrial electron donors, CYP12A1 metabolized a variety of
    insecticides and other xenobiotics, but did not metabolize ecdysteroids,
    juvenoids, or fatty acids. Subcellular localization of CYP12A1 by immunogold
    histochemistry established the mitochondrial nature of this protein. CYP12A1
    mRNA levels are constitutively higher in an insecticide-resistant strain
    than in a susceptible strain, and this trait maps to chromosome II in the
    house fly, where the constitutive overexpression of the
    pesticide-metabolizing microsomal CYP6A1 also maps. Multiple mitochondrial
    P450s have evolved in insects and may play a role in the metabolism of
    xenobiotics in addition to their possibly ancestral functions in
    steroidogenesis.

    De novo assembly of RNA-seq data enables researchers to study transcriptomes
    without the need for a genome sequence; this approach can be usefully
    applied, for instance, in research on 'non-model organisms' of ecological
    and evolutionary importance, cancer samples or the microbiome. In this
    protocol we describe the use of the Trinity platform for de novo
    transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq data in non-model organisms. We also
    present Trinity-supported companion utilities for downstream applications,
    including RSEM for transcript abundance estimation, R/Bioconductor packages
    for identifying differentially expressed transcripts across samples and
    approaches to identify protein-coding genes. In the procedure, we provide a
    workflow for genome-independent transcriptome analysis leveraging the
    Trinity platform. The software, documentation and demonstrations are freely
    available from http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net. The run time of this
    protocol is highly dependent on the size and complexity of data to be
    analyzed. The example data set analyzed in the procedure detailed herein can
    be processed in less than 5 h.

  abstract: >-
    As the Drosophila embryo transitions from the use of maternal RNAs to
    zygotic transcription, domains of open chromatin, with relatively low
    nucleosome density and specific histone marks, are established at promoters
    and enhancers involved in patterned embryonic transcription. However it
    remains unclear how regions of activity are established during early
    embryogenesis, and if they are the product of spatially restricted or
    ubiquitous processes. To shed light on this question, we probed chromatin
    accessibility across the anterior-posterior axis (A-P) of early Drosophila
    melanogaster embryos by applying a transposon based assay for chromatin
    accessibility (ATAC-seq) to anterior and posterior halves of hand-dissected,
    cellular blastoderm embryos. We find that genome-wide chromatin
    accessibility is highly similar between the two halves, with regions that
    manifest significant accessibility in one half of the embryo almost always
    accessible in the other half, even for promoters that are active in
    exclusively one half of the embryo. These data support previous studies that
    show that chromatin accessibility is not a direct result of activity, and
    point to a role for ubiquitous factors or processes in establishing
    chromatin accessibility at promoters in the early embryo. However, in
    concordance with similar works, we find that at enhancers active exclusively
    in one half of the embryo, we observe a significant skew towards greater
    accessibility in the region of their activity, highlighting the role of
    patterning factors such as Bicoid in this process.

    The siRNA-directed ribonucleoprotein complex, RISC, catalyzes target RNA
    cleavage in the RNA interference pathway. Here, we show that
    siRNA-programmed RISC is a classical Michaelis-Menten enzyme in the presence
    of ATP. In the absence of ATP, the rate of multiple rounds of catalysis is
    limited by release of the cleaved products from the enzyme. Kinetic analysis
    suggests that different regions of the siRNA play distinct roles in the
    cycle of target recognition, cleavage, and product release. Bases near the
    siRNA 5 end disproportionately contribute to target RNA-binding energy,
    whereas base pairs formed by the central and 3 regions of the siRNA provide
    a helical geometry required for catalysis. Finally, the position of the
    scissile phosphate on the target RNA seems to be determined during RISC
    assembly, before the siRNA encounters its RNA target.

    Animal development proceeds through the activity of genes and their
    cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) working together in sets of gene regulatory
    networks (GRNs). The emergence of species-specific traits and novel
    structures results from evolutionary changes in GRNs. Recent work in a wide
    variety of animal models, and particularly in insects, has started to reveal
    the modes and mechanisms of GRN evolution. I discuss here various aspects of
    GRN evolution and argue that developmental system drift (DSD), in which
    conserved phenotype is nevertheless a result of changed genetic
    interactions, should regularly be viewed from the perspective of GRN
    evolution. Advances in methods to discover related CRMs in diverse insect
    species, a critical requirement for detailed GRN characterization, are also
    described.

    High-throughput sequencing studies and new software tools are
    revolutionizing microbial community analyses, yet the variety of
    experimental and computational methods can be daunting. In this review, we
    discuss some of the different approaches to community profiling,
    highlighting strengths and weaknesses of various experimental approaches,
    sequencing methodologies, and analytical methods. We also address one key
    question emerging from various Human Microbiome Projects: Is there a
    substantial core of abundant organisms or lineages that we all share? It
    appears that in some human body habitats, such as the hand and the gut, the
    diversity among individuals is so great that we can rule out the possibility
    that any species is at high abundance in all individuals: It is possible
    that the focus should instead be on higher-level taxa or on functional genes
    instead.

    Not just in, one model system, but in virtually any organism: plants, flies,
    mice or cultured cells. This sort of experimental dream might one day become
    reality as we learn to harness the power of RNA interference, the process by
    which double-stranded RNA induces the silencing of homologous endogenous
    genes. How this phenomenon works is slowly becoming clear, and might help us
    to develop an effortless tool to probe gene function in cells and animals.

    BACKGROUND:Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA regulatory
    elements to control expression of target genes, forming the core of gene
    regulatory networks. Despite decades of research, most studies focus on only
    a small number of TFs and the roles of many remain unknown. RESULTS:We
    present a systematic characterization of spatiotemporal gene expression
    patterns for all known or predicted Drosophila TFs throughout embryogenesis,
    the first such comprehensive study for any metazoan animal. We generated RNA
    expression patterns for all 708 TFs by in situ hybridization, annotated the
    patterns using an anatomical controlled vocabulary, and analyzed TF
    expression in the context of organ system development. Nearly all TFs are
    expressed during embryogenesis and more than half are specifically expressed
    in the central nervous system. Compared to other genes, TFs are enriched
    early in the development of most organ systems, and throughout the
    development of the nervous system. Of the 535 TFs with spatially restricted
    expression, 79% are dynamically expressed in multiple organ systems while
    21% show single-organ specificity. Of those expressed in multiple organ
    systems, 77 TFs are restricted to a single organ system either early or late
    in development. Expression patterns for 354 TFs are characterized for the
    first time in this study. CONCLUSIONS:We produced a reference TF dataset for
    the investigation of gene regulatory networks in embryogenesis, and gained
    insight into the expression dynamics of the full complement of TFs
    controlling the development of each organ system.

    In flowering plants, the arrangement of flowers on a stem becomes an
    inflorescence, and a huge variety of inflorescence architecture occurs in
    nature. Inflorescence architecture also affects crop yield. In simple
    inflorescences, flowers form on a main stem; by contrast, in compound
    inflorescences, flowers form on branched stems and the branching pattern
    defines the architecture of the inflorescence. In this review, we highlight
    recent findings on the regulation of inflorescence architecture by cytokinin
    plant hormones. Results in rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana show
    that although these two species have distinct inflorescence architectures,
    cytokinins have a common effect on inflorescence branching. Based on these
    studies, we discuss how cytokinins regulate distinct types of inflorescence
    architecture through their effect on meristem activities.

    Chloroplast sequence contamination in 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S) analyses
    can be particularly problematic when sampling microbial communities in
    plants and folivorous arthropods. We previously encountered high levels of
    plastid contamination in herbivorous insect samples when we used the
    predominant 454 pyrosequencing 16S methodologies described in the
    literature. 799F, a primer previously found to exclude chloroplast
    sequences, was modified to enhance its efficacy, and we describe, in detail,
    our methodology throughout amplicon pyrosequencing. Thirteen versions of
    799F were assessed for the exclusion of chloroplast sequences from our
    samples. We found that a shift in the mismatch between 799F and chloroplast
    16S resulted in significant reduction of chloroplast reads. Our results also
    indicate that amplifying sequences from environmental samples in a two-step
    PCR process, with the addition of the multiplex identifiers and 454 adapters
    in a second round of PCR, further improved primer specificity. Primers that
    included 3′ phosphorothioate bonds, which were designed to block primer
    degradation, did not amplify consistently across samples. The different
    forward primers do not appear to bias the bacterial communities detected. We
    provide a methodological framework for reducing chloroplast reads in
    high-throughput sequencing data sets that can be applied to a number of
    environmental samples and sequencing techniques.

    Background: A major challenge of modern biology is to understand the
    networks of interacting genes regulating complex traits, and the subset of
    these genes that affect naturally occurring quantitative genetic variation.
    Previously, we used P-element mutagenesis and quantitative trait locus (QTL)
    mapping in Drosophila to identify candidate genes affecting resistance to
    starvation stress, and variation in resistance to starvation stress between
    the Oregon-R ( Ore) and 2b strains. Here, we tested the efficacy of
    whole-genome transcriptional profiling for identifying genes affecting
    starvation stress resistance.Results: We evaluated whole-genome transcript
    abundance for males and females of Ore, 2b, and four recombinant inbred
    lines derived from them, under control and starved conditions. There were
    significant differences in transcript abundance between the sexes for nearly
    50% of the genome, while the transcriptional response to starvation stress
    involved approximately 25% of the genome. Nearly 50% of P-element insertions
    in 160 genes with altered transcript abundance during starvation stress had
    mutational effects on starvation tolerance. Approximately 5% of the genome
    exhibited genetic variation in transcript abundance, which was largely
    attributable to regulation by unlinked genes. Genes exhibiting variation in
    transcript abundance among lines did not cluster within starvation
    resistance QTLs, and none of the candidate genes affecting variation in
    starvation resistance between Ore and 2b exhibited significant differences
    in transcript abundance between lines.Conclusions: Expression profiling is a
    powerful method for identifying networks of pleiotropic genes regulating
    complex traits, but the relationship between variation in transcript
    abundance among lines used to map QTLs and genes affecting variation in
    quantitative traits is complicated.

    BACKGROUND: Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are among the most important
    pollinators in natural and agricultural settings. They commonly encounter
    insecticides, and the effects of insecticides on honey bees have been
    frequently noted. It has been suggested that honey bees may be (as a
    species) uniquely sensitive to insecticides, although no comparative
    toxicology study has been undertaken to examine this claim. An extensive
    literature review was conducted, using data in which adult insects were
    topically treated with insecticides. The goal of this review was to
    summarize insecticide toxicity data between A. mellifera and other insects
    to determine the relative sensitivity of honey bees to insecticides.
    RESULTS: It was found that, in general, honey bees were no more sensitive
    than other insect species across the 62 insecticides examined. In addition,
    honey bees were not more sensitive to any of the six classes of insecticides
    (carbamates, nicotinoids, organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids and
    miscellaneous) examined. CONCLUSIONS: While honey bees can be sensitive to
    individual insecticides, they are not a highly sensitive species to
    insecticides overall, or even to specific classes of insecticides. However,
    all pesticides should be used in a way that minimizes honey bee exposure, so
    as to minimize possible declines in the number of bees and/or honey
    contamination. Copyright © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry

    The advent of second-generation sequencing and its application to RNA
    sequencing has revolutionized the field of genomics by allowing the
    quantification of expression of entire genes as well as single TSS, exons
    and splice sites, RNA-editing sites as well as polyA-sites. However, due to
    the sequencing of fragments of cDNAs these methods have not given a reliable
    picture of complete RNA isoforms. Third-generation sequencing has filled
    this gap and allows end-to-end sequencing of entire RNA/cDNA molecules. This
    approach to transcriptomics has been a ‘niche’ technology for a couple of
    years but now is becoming mainstream with many different applications. Here,
    we review the background and progress made to date in this rapidly growing
    field. We start by reviewing the progressive realization that alternative
    splicing is omnipresent. We then focus on long-non-coding RNA isoforms and
    the distinct combination patterns of exons in non-coding and coding genes.
    We consider the implications of the recent technologies of direct RNA
    sequencing and single-cell isoform RNA sequencing. Finally, we discuss the
    parameters that define the success of long-read RNA sequencing experiments
    and strategies commonly used to make the most of such data.

    We have performed an F2 genetic screen to identify lethal mutations within
    the 63E-64A genomic region. We have isolated 122 mutations in 20 different
    complementation groups. Of these groups, 16 are represented by multiple
    alleles. We have also established that the Rop and Ras2 genes are located
    within the 63E-64A genomic domain at 64A10,11. We have sequenced 10.2 kb of
    DNA surrounding this gene pair and find that in addition to Rop and Ras2
    there is another gene located within this DNA sequence. The gene product,
    which we have named Rfc40, shows 68% identity to the 40-kDa subunit of
    replication factor C. We find that the members of one complementation group
    (13 alleles) derived from our screen correspond to mutations in the Rop
    gene, whereas the members of another (five alleles) correspond to mutations
    in the Rfc40 gene. In addition we have isolated 11 new mutant alleles of the
    disembodied gene.

    Differential gene expression analysis may discover a set of genes too large
    to easily investigate, so a means of ranking genes by biological interest
    level is desired. p values are frequently abused for this purpose. As an
    alternative, we propose a method of ranking by confidence bounds on the log
    fold change, based on the previously developed TREAT test. These confidence
    bounds provide guaranteed false discovery rate and false coverage-statement
    rate control. When applied to a breast cancer dataset, the top-ranked genes
    by Topconfects emphasize markedly different biological processes compared to
    the top-ranked genes by p value.

    BACKGROUND Nitenpyram is a member of the economically important
    neonicotinoid class of insecticides. The in vivo metabolism of nitenpyram is
    not well characterised, but cytochrome P450 activity is the major mechanism
    of resistance to neonicotinoids identified in insect pests, and P450s
    metabolise other neonicotinoids including imidacloprid. RESULTS Here, we
    used the GAL4-UAS targeted expression system to direct RNA interference
    (RNAi) against the cytochrome P450 redox partners to interrupt P450
    functions in specific tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. RNAi of the
    mitochondrial redox partner defective in the avoidance of repellents (dare)
    in the digestive tissues reduced nitenpyram mortality, suggesting an
    activation step in the metabolism of nitenpyram carried out by a
    mitochondrial P450. RNAi of the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 Cyp12a5, which
    is expressed in the digestive tissues, resulted in the same phenotype, and
    transgenic overexpression of Cyp12a5 increased nitenpyram sensitivity.
    CONCLUSION These results suggest that in vivo metabolism of nitenpyram by
    the mitochondrial P450 CYP12A5 results in the formation of a product with
    higher toxicity than the parent compound. © 2018 Society of Chemical

  abstract: >-
    Widespread use of insecticides has led to insecticide resistance in many
    populations of insects. In some populations, resistance has evolved to
    multiple pesticides. In Drosophila melanogaster, resistance to multiple
    classes of insecticide is due to the overexpression of a single cytochrome
    P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Overexpression of Cyp6g1 appears to have evolved in
    parallel in Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster, where
    it is also associated with insecticide resistance. However, it is not known
    whether the ability of the CYP6G1 enzyme to provide resistance to multiple
    insecticides evolved recently in D. melanogaster or if this function is
    present in all Drosophila species. Here we show that duplication of the
    Cyp6g1 gene occurred at least four times during the evolution of different
    Drosophila species, and the ability of CYP6G1 to confer resistance to
    multiple insecticides exists in D. melanogaster and D. simulans but not in
    Drosophila willistoni or Drosophila virilis. In D. virilis, which has
    multiple copies of Cyp6g1, one copy confers resistance to DDT and another to
    nitenpyram, suggesting that the divergence of protein sequence between
    copies subsequent to the duplication affected the activity of the enzyme.
    All orthologs tested conferred resistance to one or more insecticides,
    suggesting that CYP6G1 had the capacity to provide resistance to
    anthropogenic chemicals before they existed. Finally, we show that
    expression of Cyp6g1 in the Malpighian tubules, which contributes to DDT
    resistance in D. melanogaster, is specific to the D. melanogaster–D.
    simulans lineage. Our results suggest that a combination of gene
    duplication, regulatory changes and protein coding changes has taken place
    at the Cyp6g1 locus during evolution and this locus may play a role in
    providing resistance to different environmental toxins in different
    Drosophila species.

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450s are a large superfamily of genes that are found in all
    eukaryotic organisms. Historically, P450s in insects have been classified
    either as steroid biosynthesis or xenobiotic detoxification enzymes, but it
    is now clear that they are important in a far wider range of biological
    processes, and the function of most of the P450 genes in Drosophila
    melanogaster is not known. Increasing evidence suggests that P450s may have
    a role in olfaction, possibly via termination of the olfactory stimulus by
    degradation of odorants in the support cells of the olfactory sensilla. In
    this study, the expression patterns of D. melanogaster P450s in the antennae
    was analysed by reverse transcriptase PCR. 39 P450s were detected in the
    antennae, which is further evidence that they are involved in olfaction. A
    novel system for investigating P450 functions in vivo was developed. Two
    essential redox partners of P450 proteins, CPR and Dare, supply electrons to

    Transgenic RNAi of Cpr and dare was used with the GAL4–UAS system in
    specific tissues and life stages, and was shown to inhibit P450 activity.
    RNAi of Cpr and dare in the classic detoxification tissues of D.
    melanogaster, the midgut, Malpighian tubules and fat body, was used in
    combination with bioassays with the insecticides
    dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), nitenpyram and dicyclanil to
    investigate P450-mediated metabolism of these compounds. dare RNAi lead to
    increased survival of larvae reared on nitenpyram, suggesting a
    mitochondrial P450 is involved in the activation of this compound.

    In rice, inflorescence architecture is established at early stages of
    reproductive development and contributes directly to grain yield potential.
    After induction of flowering, the complexity of branching, and therefore the
    number of seeds on the panicle, is determined by the activity of different
    meristem types and the timing of transitions between them. Although some of
    the genes involved in these transitions have been identified, an
    understanding of the network of transcriptional regulators controlling this
    process is lacking. To address this we used a precise laser microdissection
    and RNA-sequencing approach in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare to
    produce quantitative data that describe the landscape of gene expression in
    four different meristem types: the rachis meristem, the primary branch
    meristem, the elongating primary branch meristem (including axillary
    meristems), and the spikelet meristem. A switch in expression profile
    between apical and axillary meristem types followed by more gradual changes
    during transitions in axillary meristem identity was observed, and several
    genes potentially involved in branching were identified. This resource will
    be vital for a mechanistic understanding of the link between inflorescence
    development and grain yield.

    Modified, agricultural landscapes are susceptible to damage by insect pests.
    Biological control of pests is typically successful once a control agent has
    established, but this depends on the agent&rsquo;s capacity to co-evolve
    with the host. Theoretical studies have shown that different levels of
    genetic variation between the host and the control agent will lead to rapid
    evolution of resistance in the host. Although this has been reported in one
    instance, the underlying genetics have not been studied. To address this, we
    measured the genetic variation in New Zealand populations of the pasture
    pest, Argentine stem weevil (Listronotus bonariensis), which is controlled
    with declining effectiveness by a parasitoid wasp, Microctonus hyperodae. We
    constructed a draft reference genome of the weevil, collected samples from a
    geographical survey of 10 sites around New Zealand, and genotyped them using
    a modified genotyping-by-sequencing approach. New Zealand populations of
    Argentine stem weevil have high levels of heterozygosity and low population
    structure, consistent with a large effective population size and frequent
    gene flow. This implies that Argentine stem weevils were able to evolve more
    rapidly than their biocontrol agent, which reproduces asexually. These
    findings show that monitoring genetic diversity in biocontrol agents and
    their targets is critical for long-term success of biological control.

    Survival of insects on a substrate containing toxic substances such as plant
    secondary metabolites or insecticides is dependent on the metabolism or
    excretion of those xenobiotics. The primary sites of xenobiotic metabolism
    are the midgut, Malpighian tubules, and fat body. In general, gene
    expression in these organs is reported for the entire tissue by online
    databases, but several studies have shown that gene expression within the
    midgut is compartmentalized. Here, RNA sequencing is used to investigate
    whole-genome expression in subsections of third instar larval midguts of
    Drosophila melanogaster. The data support functional diversification in
    subsections of the midgut. Analysis of the expression of gene families that
    are implicated in the metabolism of xenobiotics suggests that metabolism may
    not be uniform along the midgut. These data provide a starting point for
    investigating gene expression and xenobiotic metabolism and other functions
    of the larval midgut.

    Background: Cytochromes P450 catalyze the oxidation of a variety of
    hydrophobic substrates. Sequence identities between P450 families are
    generally low (10-30%), and consequently, the structure-function
    correlations among P450s are not clear. The crystal structures of P450(terp)
    and the hemoprotein domain of P450(BM-3) were recently determined, and are
    compared here with the previously available structure of P450(cam).Results:
    The topology of all three enzymes is quite similar. The heme-binding core
    structure is well conserved, except for local differences in the I helices.
    The greatest variation is observed in the substrate-binding regions. The
    structural superposition of the proteins permits an improved sequence
    alignment of other P450s. The charge distribution in the three structures is
    similarly asymmetric and defines a molecular dipole.Conclusions: Based on
    this comparison we believe that all P450s will be found to possess the same
    tertiary structure. The ability to precisely predict other P450
    substratecontact residues is limited by the extreme structural heterogeneity
    in the substrate-recognition regions. The central I-helix structures of
    P450(terp) and P45O(BM-3) suggest a role for helix-associated solvent
    molecules as a source of catalytic protons, distinct from the mechanism for
    P450(cam). We suggest that the P450 molecular dipole for P450 might aid in
    both redox-partner docking and proton recruitment for catalysis.

  abstract: "The cytochrome P450 proteins (CYPs) are a family of haem proteins resulting from ex- pression of a gene super-family that currently contains around 1000 members in species ranging from bacteria through to plants and animals. In humans, about 40 di\U0010FC22erent CYPs are present and these play critical roles by catalyzing reactions in: (a) the metabolism of drugs, environmental pollutants and other xenobiotics; (b) the biosynthesis of steroid hormones; (c) the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids to intracellular messengers; and (d) the stereo- and regio-speci®c metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins. This review deals with aspects of cytochrome P450s of relevance to human physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology and medicine. Topics reviewed include: pharmacogenetics of CYPs, induction and inhibition of these haem proteins, their role in metabolism of endogenous compounds such as steroids and eicosanoids, the e\U0010FC22ect of disease on CYP function, CYPs and cancer, and CYPs as targets of antibodies in immune- mediated diseases."

    Sex determination in honeybees (Apis mellifera) is governed by
    heterozygosity at a single locus harbouring the complementary sex determiner
    (csd) gene1, in contrast to the well-studied sex chromosome system of
    Drosophila melanogaster2. Bees heterozygous at csd are females, whereas
    homozygotes and hemizygotes (haploid individuals) are males. Although at
    least 15 different csd alleles are known among natural bee populations3, the
    mechanisms linking allelic interactions to switching of the sexual
    development programme are still obscure. Here we report a new component of
    the sex-determining pathway in honeybees, encoded 12 kilobases upstream of
    csd. The gene feminizer (fem) is the ancestrally conserved progenitor gene
    from which csd arose and encodes an SR-type protein, harbouring an
    Arg/Ser-rich domain. Fem shares the same arrangement of Arg/Ser- and
    proline-rich-domain with the Drosophila principal sex-determining gene
    transformer (tra), but lacks conserved motifs except for a 30-amino-acid
    motif that Fem shares only with Tra of another fly, Ceratitis capitata4.
    Like tra, the fem transcript is alternatively spliced. The male-specific
    splice variant contains a premature stop codon and yields no functional
    product, whereas the female-specific splice variant encodes the functional
    protein. We show that RNA interference (RNAi)-induced knockdowns of the
    female-specific fem splice variant result in male bees, indicating that the
    fem product is required for entire female development. Furthermore,
    RNAi-induced knockdowns of female allelic csd transcripts result in the
    male-specific fem splice variant, suggesting that the fem gene implements
    the switch of developmental pathways controlled by heterozygosity at csd.
    Comparative analysis of fem and csd coding sequences from five bee species
    indicates a recent origin of csd in the honeybee lineage from the fem
    progenitor and provides evidence for positive selection at csd accompanied
    by purifying selection at fem. The fem locus in bees uncovers gene
    duplication and positive selection as evolutionary mechanisms underlying the
    origin of a novel sex determination pathway.

    Recombination decreases the association of linked nucleotide sites and can
    influence levels of polymorphism in natural populations. When coupled with
    selection, recombination may relax potential conflict among linked genes, a
    concept that has played a central role in research on the evolution of
    recombination. The sex determination locus (SDL) of the honeybee is an
    informative example for exploring the combined forces of recombination,
    selection, and linkage on sequence evolution. Balancing selection at SDL is
    very strong and homozygous individuals at SDL are eliminated by worker bees.
    The recombination rate is increased up to four times that of the genomewide
    average in the region surrounding SDL. Analysis of nucleotide diversity (π)
    reveals a sevenfold increase of polymorphism within the sex determination
    gene complementary sex determiner (csd) that rapidly declines within 45 kb
    to levels of genomewide estimates. Although no recombination was observed
    within SDL, which contains csd, analyses of heterogeneity, shared
    polymorphic sites, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) show that recombination
    has contributed to the evolution of the 5′ part of some csd sequences. Gene
    conversion, however, has not obviously contributed to the evolution of csd
    sequences. The local control of recombination appears to be related to SDL
    function and mode of selection. The homogenizing force of recombination is
    reduced within SDL, which preserves allelic differences and specificity,
    while the increase of recombination activity around SDL relaxes conflict
    between SDL and linked genes.

    and its orthologue in Drosophila melanogaster were expressed in Sf9 cells
    transfected with recombinant baculovirus. Resistance of L. cuprina to
    organophosphorus insecticides is due to mutations in the E3 gene that
    enhance the enzyme's ability to hydrolyse insecticides. Previous in vitro
    mutagenesis and expression of these modifications (G137D, in the oxyanion
    hole and W251L, in the acyl pocket) have confirmed their functional
    significance. We have systematically substituted these and nearby amino
    acids by others expected to affect the hydrolysis of pyrethroid
    insecticides. Most mutations of G137 markedly decreased pyrethroid
    hydrolysis. W251L was the most effective of five substitutions at this
    position. It increased activity with trans permethrin 10-fold, and the more
    insecticidal cis permethrin >130-fold, thereby decreasing the trans:cis
    hydrolysis ratio to only 2, compared with >25 in the wild-type enzyme. Other
    mutations near the bottom of the catalytic cleft generally enhanced
    pyrethroid hydrolysis, the most effective being F309L, also in the
    presumptive acyl binding pocket, which enhanced trans permethrin hydrolysis
    even more than W251L. In these assays with racemic 1RS cis and 1RS trans
    permethrin, two phases were apparent, one being much faster suggesting
    preferential hydrolysis of one enantiomer in each pair as found previously
    with other esterases. Complementary assays with individual enantiomers of
    deltamethrin and the dibromo analogue of cis permethrin showed that the wild
    type and most mutants showed a marked preference for the least insecticidal
    1S configuration, but this was reversed by the F309L substitution. The
    W251L/F309L double mutant was best overall in hydrolysing the most
    insecticidal 1R cis isomers. The results are discussed in relation to likely
    steric effects on enzyme-substrate interactions, cross-resistance between
    pyrethroids and malathion, and the potential for bioremediation of
    pyrethroid residues.

  abstract: >-
    The molecular analysis of insect hormone biosynthesis has long been hampered
    by the minute size of the endocrine glands producing them. Expressed
    sequence tags from the corpora allata of the cockroach Diploptera punctata
    yielded a new cytochrome P450, CYP15A1. Its full-length cDNA encoded a
    493-aa protein that has only 34% amino acid identity with CYP4C7, a
    terpenoid omega-hydroxylase previously cloned from this tissue. Heterologous
    expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli produced >300 nmol of CYP15A1 per
    liter of culture. After purification, its catalytic activity was
    reconstituted by using phospholipids and house fly P450 reductase. CYP15A1
    metabolizes methyl (2E,6E)-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6-dodecatrienoate(methyl
    farnesoate)to methyl
    (2E,6E)-(10R)-10,11-epoxy3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6-dodecadienoate [juvenile
    hormone III, JH III] with a turnover of 3-5 nmol/min/nmol P450. The enzyme
    produces JH III with a ratio of approximate to98:2 in favor of the natural
    (10R)-epoxide enantiomer. This result is in contrast to other insect P450s,
    such as CYP6A1, that epoxidize methyl farnesoate with lower regio- and
    stereoselectivity. RT-PCR experiments show that the CYP15A1 gene is
    expressed selectively in the corpora allata of D. punctata, at the time of
    maximal JH production by the glands. We thus report the cloning and
    functional expression of a gene involved in an insect-specific step of
    juvenile hormone biosynthesis. Heterologously expressed CYP15A1 from D.
    punctata or its ortholog from economically important species may be useful
    in the design and screening of selective insect control agents.

  abstract: >-
    Only a handful of P450 genes have been functionally characterized from the
    approximately 90 recently identified in the genome of Drosophila
    melanogaster. Cyp6a8 encodes a 506-amino acid protein with 53.6% amino acid
    identity with CYP6A2. CYP6A2 has been shown to catalyze the metabolism of
    several insecticides including aldrin and heptachlor. CYP6A8 is expressed at
    many developmental stages as well as in adult life. CYP6A8 was produced in
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae and enzymatically characterized after catalytic
    activity was reconstituted with D. melanogaster P450 reductase and NADPH.
    Although several saturated or non-saturated fatty acids were not metabolized
    by CYP6A8, lauric acid (C12:0), a short-chain unsaturated fatty acid, was
    oxidized by CYP6A8 to produce 11-hydroxylauric acid with an apparent V-max
    of 25 nmol/min/nmol P450. This is the first report showing that a member of
    the CYP6 family catalyzes the hydroxylation of lauric acid. Our data open
    new prospects for the CYP6 P450 enzymes, which could be involved in
    important physiological functions through fatty acid metabolism. (C) 2004

    The major mechanism of organophosphorus insecticide resistance in Culex
    mosquitoes involves the elevation of one or mon esterases. The general
    mechanism underlying this resistance is the amplification of the structural
    genes. This review covers the classification of the mosquito esterases in
    the context of classical esterase nomenclature. The function of the
    amplified esterases and the structure of the amplified DNA on which they
    occur are also described. Implications of information on the esterase
    amplicons are discussed in relation to the evolution and migration of
    insecticide resistance in Culex.

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases catalyze the oxidation of a large
    number of endogenous compounds and the majority of ingested environmental
    chemicals, leading to their elimination and often to their metabolic
    activation to toxic products. This enzyme system therefore provides our
    primary defense against xenobiotics and is a major determinant in the
    therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological agents. To evaluate the importance
    of hepatic P450s in normal homeostasis, drug pharmacology, and chemical
    toxicity, we have conditionally deleted the essential electron transfer
    protein, NADH:ferrihemoprotein reductase (EC 1.6.2.4, cytochrome P450
    reductase, CPR) in the liver, resulting in essentially complete ablation of
    hepatic microsomal P450 activity. Hepatic CPR-null mice could no longer
    break down cholesterol because of their inability to produce bile acids, and
    whereas hepatic lipid levels were significantly increased, circulating
    levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were severely reduced. Loss of
    hepatic P450 activity resulted in a 5-fold increase in P450 protein,
    indicating the existence of a negative feedback pathway regulating P450
    expression. Profound changes in the in vivo metabolism of pentobarbital and
    acetaminophen indicated that extrahepatic metabolism does not play a major
    role in the disposition of these compounds. Hepatic CPR-null mice developed
    normally and were able to breed, indicating that hepatic microsomal
    P450-mediated steroid hormone metabolism is not essential for fertility,
    demonstrating that a major evolutionary role for hepatic P450s is to protect
    mammals from their environment.

    The natural distribution of the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) has been
    changed by humans in recent decades to such an extent that the formerly
    widest-spread European subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera, is threatened
    by extinction through introgression from highly divergent commercial strains
    in large tracts of its range. Conservation efforts for A. m. mellifera are
    underway in multiple European countries requiring reliable and
    cost-efficient molecular tools to identify purebred colonies. Here, we
    developed four ancestry-informative SNP assays for high sample throughput
    genotyping using the iPLEX Mass Array system. Our customized assays were
    tested on DNA from individual and pooled, haploid and diploid honeybee
    samples extracted from different tissues using a diverse range of protocols.
    The assays had a high genotyping success rate and yielded accurate
    genotypes. Performance assessed against whole-genome data showed that
    individual assays behaved well, although the most accurate introgression
    estimates were obtained for the four assays combined (117 SNPs). The best
    compromise between accuracy and genotyping costs was achieved when combining
    two assays (62 SNPs). We provide a ready-to-use cost-effective tool for
    accurate molecular identification and estimation of introgression levels to
    more effectively monitor and manage A. m. mellifera conservatories.

  abstract: >-
    The reconstruction of many biological networks has allowed detailed studies
    of their structural properties. Several features exhibited by these networks
    have been interpreted to be the result of evolutionary dynamics. For
    instance the degree distributions may follow from a preferential attachment
    of new genes to older ones during evolution. Here we argue that even in the
    absence of any evolutionary dynamics, the presence of atypical features may
    follow from the fact that the network implements certain functions. To
    examine this network function shapes network structure scenario, we focus on
    the Arabidopsis genetic network controlling early flower organogenesis in
    which gene expression dynamics has been modelled using a Boolean framework.
    Specifically, for a system with 15 master genes, the phenotype consists of
    10 experimentally determined steady-state expression patterns, considered
    here as the functional constraints on the network. The space of genetic
    networks satisfying these constraints is sometimes referred to as the
    neutral or genotype network. We sample this space using Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo which allows us to demonstrate how the functional (phenotypic)
    constraints shape the gene network structure. We find that this shaping is
    strongest for the edge (interaction) usage, with effects that are
    functionally interpretable. In contrast, higher order features such as
    degree assortativity and network motifs are hardly shaped by the phenotypic
    constraints.

    Characterization of seven MADS-box genes, termed PPM1-PPM4 and
    PpMADS1-PpMADS3, from the moss model species Physcomitrella patens is
    reported. Phylogeny reconstructions and comparison of exon-intron structures
    revealed that the genes described here represent two different classes of
    homologous, yet distinct, MIKC-type MADS-box genes, termed MIKC(c)-type
    genes-"(c)" stands for "classic"-(PPM1, PPM2, PpMADS1) and MIKC(*)-type
    genes (PPM3, PPM4, PpMADS2, PpMADS3). The two gene classes deviate from each
    other in a characteristic way, especially in a sequence stretch termed
    intervening region. MIKC(c)-type genes are abundantly present in all land
    plants which have been investigated in this respect, and give rise to
    well-known gene types such as floral meristem and organ identity genes. In
    contrast, LAMB1 from the clubmoss Lycopodium annotinum was identified as the
    only other MIKC(*)-type gene published so far. Our findings strongly suggest
    that the most recent common ancestor of mosses and vascular plants contained
    at least one MIKC(c)-type and one MIKC(*)-type gene. Our studies thus reveal
    an ancient duplication of an MIKC-type gene that occurred before the
    separation of the lineages that led to extant mosses and vascular plants
    more than about 450 MYA. The identification of bona fide K-domains in both
    MIKC(*)-type and MIKC(c)-type proteins suggests that the K-domain is more
    ancient than is suggested by a recent alternative hypothesis. MIKC(*)-type
    genes may have escaped identification in ferns and seed plants so far. It
    seems more likely, however, that they represent a class of genes which has
    been lost in the lineage which led to extant ferns and seed plants. The high
    number of P. patens MADS-box genes and the presence of a K-box in the coding
    region and of some potential binding sites for MADS-domain proteins and
    other transcription factors in the putative promoter regions of these genes
    suggest that MADS-box genes in mosses are involved in complex gene
    regulatory networks similar to those in flowering plants.

    High throughput sequencing of phylogenetic and functional gene amplicons
    provides tremendous insight into the structure and functional potential of
    complex microbial communities. Here, we introduce a highly adaptable and
    economical PCR approach to barcoding and pooling libraries of numerous
    target genes. In this approach, we replace gene- and sequencing
    platform-specific fusion primers with general, interchangeable barcoding
    primers, enabling nearly limitless customized barcode-primer combinations.
    Compared to barcoding with long fusion primers, our multiple-target gene
    approach is more economical because it overall requires lower number of
    primers and is based on short primers with generally lower synthesis and
    purification costs. To highlight our approach, we pooled over 900 different
    small-subunit rRNA and functional gene amplicon libraries obtained from
    various environmental or host-associated microbial community samples into a
    single, paired-end Illumina MiSeq run. Although the amplicon regions ranged
    in size from approximately 290 to 720 bp, we found no significant systematic
    sequencing bias related to amplicon length or gene target. Our results
    indicate that this flexible multiplexing approach produces large, diverse
    and high quality sets of amplicon sequence data for modern studies in
    microbial ecology.

    There are few studies comparing the effects of low-carbohydrate/high-protein
    diets with low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets for obesity and cardiovascular
    disease risk. This systematic review focuses on randomized controlled trials
    of low-carbohydrate diets compared with low-fat/low-calorie diets. Studies
    conducted in adult populations with mean or median body mass index of >= 28
    kg m(-2) were included. Thirteen electronic databases were searched and
    randomized controlled trials from January 2000 to March 2007 were evaluated.
    Trials were included if they lasted at least 6 months and assessed the
    weight-loss effects of low-carbohydrate diets against low-fat/low-calorie
    diets. For each study, data were abstracted and checked by two researchers
    prior to electronic data entry. The computer program Review Manager 4.2.2
    was used for the data analysis. Thirteen articles met the inclusion
    criteria. There were significant differences between the groups for weight,
    high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triacylglycerols and systolic blood
    pressure, favouring the low-carbohydrate diet. There was a higher attrition
    rate in the low-fat compared with the low-carbohydrate groups suggesting a
    patient preference for a low-carbohydrate/high-protein approach as opposed
    to the Public Health preference of a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet.
    Evidence from this systematic review demonstrates that
    low-carbohydrate/high-protein diets are more effective at 6 months and are
    as effective, if not more, as low-fat diets in reducing weight and
    cardiovascular disease risk up to 1 year. More evidence and longer-term
    studies are needed to assess the long-term cardiovascular benefits from the
    weight loss achieved using these diets.

    Genealogical patterns in different genomic regions may be different due to
    the joint influence of gene flow and selection. The existence of two
    subspecies of cultivated rice provides a unique opportunity for analyzing
    these effects during domestication. We chose 66 accessions from the three
    rice taxa (about 22 each from Oryza sativa indica, O. sativa japonica, and
    O. rufipogon) for whole-genome sequencing. In the search for the signature
    of selection, we focus on low diversity regions (LDRs) shared by both
    cultivars. We found that the genealogical histories of these overlapping
    LDRs are distinct from the genomic background. While indica and japonica
    genomes generally appear to be of independent origin, many overlapping LDRs
    may have originated only once, as a result of selection and subsequent
    introgression. Interestingly, many such LDRs contain only one candidate gene
    of rice domestication, and several known domestication genes have indeed
    been "rediscovered" by this approach. In summary, we identified 13
    additional candidate genes of domestication.

    Structural variants (SVs) remain challenging to represent and study relative
    to point mutations despite their demonstrated importance. We show that
    variation graphs, as implemented in the vg toolkit, provide an effective
    means for leveraging SV catalogs for short-read SV genotyping experiments.
    We benchmark vg against state-of-the-art SV genotypers using three
    sequence-resolved SV catalogs generated by recent long-read sequencing
    studies. In addition, we use assemblies from 12 yeast strains to show that
    graphs constructed directly from aligned de novo assemblies improve
    genotyping compared to graphs built from intermediate SV catalogs in the VCF
    format.

    Although transposable elements (TEs) are known to be potent sources of
    mutation, their contribution to the generation of recent adaptive changes
    has never been systematically assessed. In this work, we conduct a
    genomewide screen for adaptive TE insertions in Drosophila melanogaster that
    have taken place during or after the spread of this species out of Africa.
    We determine population frequencies of 902 of the 1,572 TEs in Release 3 of
    the D. melanogaster genome and identify a set of 13 putatively adaptive TEs.
    These 13 TEs increased in population frequency sharply after the spread out
    of Africa. We argue that many of these TEs are in fact adaptive by
    demonstrating that the regions flanking five of these TEs display signatures
    of partial selective sweeps. Furthermore, we show that eight out of the 13
    putatively adaptive elements show population frequency heterogeneity
    consistent with these elements playing a role in adaptation to temperate
    climates. We conclude that TEs have contributed considerably to recent
    adaptive evolution (one TE-induced adaptation every 200-1,250 y). The
    majority of these adaptive insertions are likely to be involved in
    regulatory changes. Our results also suggest that TE-induced adaptations
    arise more often from standing variants than from new mutations. Such a high
    rate of TE-induced adaptation is inconsistent with the number of fixed TEs
    in the D. melanogaster genome, and we discuss possible explanations for this
    discrepancy.

  abstract: >-
    ABI1, a protein phosphatase 2C, is a key component of signal transduction in
    Arabidopsis. It regulates diverse responses to the phytohormone abscisic
    acid (ABA) such as stomatal closure, seed dormancy and inhibition of
    vegetative growth. By analysing proteins capable of interacting with ABI1,
    we have identified the homeodomain protein ATHB6 as a regulator of the ABA
    signal pathway. Critical for interaction between ATHB6 and ABI1 is an intact
    protein phosphatase domain and the N-terminal domain of ATHB6 containing the
    DNA-binding site. ATHB6 recognizes a cis-element present in its promoter,
    which encompasses the core motif (CAATTATTA) that mediated ATHB6- and
    ABA-dependent gene expression in protoplasts. In addition, transgenic plants
    containing a luciferase gene controlled by the ATHB6 promoter documented a
    strong ABA-inducible expression of the reporter which was abrogated in the
    ABA-insensitive abi1 mutant. Arabidopsis plants with constitutive expression
    of the transcriptional regulator revealed ABA insensitivity in a subset of
    ABI1-dependent responses. Thus, the homeodomain protein ATHB6 seems to
    represent a negative regulator of the ABA signal pathway and to act
    downstream of ABI1.

  abstract: >-
    We report here the consequences of mutations of a novel locus, named bantam,
    whose product is involved in the regulation of growth in Drosophila. bantam
    mutant animals are smaller than wild type, due to a reduction in cell number
    but not cell size, and do not have significant disruptions in patterning.
    Conversely, overexpression of the bantam product using the EP element
    EP(3)3622 causes overgrowth of wing and eye tissue. Overexpression in clones
    of cells results in an increased rate of cell proliferation and a matched
    increase in cellular growth rate, such that the resulting tissue is composed
    of more cells of a size comparable to wild type. These effects are
    strikingly similar to those associated with alterations in the activity of
    the cyclinD-cdk4 complex. However, epistasis and genetic interaction
    analyses indicate that bantam and cyclinD-cdk4 operate independently. Thus,
    the bantam locus represents a novel regulator of tissue growth.

    To investigate the involvement of phytohormones during rice
    microspore/pollen (MS/POL) development, endogenous levels of IAA,
    gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CKs) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the mature
    anther were analyzed. We also analyzed the global expression profiles of
    genes related to seven phytohormones, namely auxin, GAs, CKs,
    brassinosteroids, ethylene, ABA and jasmonic acids, in MS/POL and tapetum
    (TAP) using a 44K microarray combined with a laser microdissection technique
    (LM-array analysis). IAA and GA(4) accumulated in a much higher amount in
    the mature anther compared with the other tissues, while CKs and ABA did
    not. LM-array analysis revealed that sets of genes required for IAA and GA
    synthesis were coordinately expressed during the later stages of MS/POL
    development, suggesting that these genes are responsible for the massive
    accumulation of IAA and GA(4) in the mature anther. In contrast, genes for
    GA signaling were preferentially expressed during the early developmental
    stages of MS/POL and throughout TAP development, while their expression was
    down-regulated at the later stages of MS/POL development. In the case of
    auxin signaling genes, such mirror-imaged expression observed in GA
    synthesis and signaling genes was not observed. IAA receptor genes were
    mostly expressed during the late stages of MS/POL development, and various
    sets of AUX/IAA and ARF genes were expressed during the different stages of
    MS/POL or TAP development. Such cell type-specific expression profiles of
    phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling genes demonstrate the validity and
    importance of analyzing the expression of phytohormone-related genes in
    individual cell types independently of other cells/tissues.

    Genome-wide analyses of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytokinin (CK)-responsive
    genes using the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) rice genome array were conducted to
    define the spectrum of genes subject to regulation by CK in monocotyledonous
    plants. Application of trans-zeatin modulated the expression of a wide
    variety of genes including those involved in hormone signaling and
    metabolism, transcriptional regulation, macronutrient transport and protein
    synthesis. To understand further the function of CK in rice plants, we
    examined the effects of in planta manipulation of a putative CK signaling
    factor on morphology, CK metabolism and expression of CK-responsive genes.
    Overexpression of the CK-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 abolished
    shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK
    signaling. Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf
    phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles. Increased
    content of trans-zeatin-type CKs in OsRR6-ox lines indicates that
    homeostatic control of CK levels is regulated by OsRR6 signaling. Expression
    of genes encoding CK oxidase/dehydrogenase decreased in OsRR6-ox plants,
    possibly accounting for elevated CK levels in transgenic lines. Expression
    of a number of stress response genes was also altered in OsRR6-ox plants.

  abstract: >-
    In Drosophila, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) respond to oxidative challenges
    and inflammation by increasing proliferation rates. This phenotype is part
    of a regenerative response, but can lead to hyperproliferation and
    epithelial degeneration in the aging animal. Here we show that Nrf2, a
    master regulator of the cellular redox state, specifically controls the
    proliferative activity of ISCs, promoting intestinal homeostasis. We find
    that Nrf2 is constitutively active in ISCs and that repression of Nrf2 by
    its negative regulator Keap1 is required for ISC proliferation. We further
    show that Nrf2 and Keap1 exert this function in ISCs by regulating the
    intracellular redox balance. Accordingly, loss of Nrf2 in ISCs causes
    accumulation of reactive oxygen species and accelerates age-related
    degeneration of the intestinal epithelium. Our findings establish Keap1 and
    Nrf2 as a critical redox management system that regulates stem cell function
    in high-turnover tissues.

  abstract: >-
    When substantial mortality occurs in the control group of an acute bioassay,
    probit analysis and other methods to estimate the LC50 are usually
    supplemented with Abbott's correction (Abbott, 1925). This paper discusses
    the probit model with this adaption. Estimates of the LC50 obtained by
    probit analysis ignoring natural mortality or by probit analysis applied to
    data corrected with Abbott's formula beforehand are compared with maximum
    likelihood estimates based on the model. It is demonstrated that ignoring
    control mortality can lead to biased estimates of the LC50 even at low
    percentages of control mortality. For interpretation of the LC50 a
    distinction is made between control mortality caused by natural processes
    and control mortality caused by experimental manipulation.

  abstract: >-
    An important tenet of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo devo") is
    that adaptive mutations affecting morphology are more likely to occur in the
    cis-regulatory regions than in the protein-coding regions of genes. This
    argument rests on two claims: ( 1) the modular nature of cis-regulatory
    elements largely frees them from deleterious pleiotropic effects, and ( 2) a
    growing body of empirical evidence appears to support the predominant role
    of gene regulatory change in adaptation, especially morphological
    adaptation. Here we discuss and critique these assertions. We first show
    that there is no theoretical or empirical basis for the evo devo contention
    that adaptations involving morphology evolve by genetic mechanisms different
    from those involving physiology and other traits. In addition, some forms of
    protein evolution can avoid the negative consequences of pleiotropy, most
    notably via gene duplication. In light of evo devo claims, we then examine
    the substantial data on the genetic basis of adaptation from both
    genome-wide surveys and single-locus studies. Genomic studies lend little
    support to the cis-regulatory theory: many of these have detected adaptation
    in protein-coding regions, including transcription factors, whereas few have
    examined regulatory regions. Turning to single-locus studies, we note that
    the most widely cited examples of adaptive cis-regulatory mutations focus on
    trait loss rather than gain, and none have yet pinpointed an evolved
    regulatory site. In contrast, there are many studies that have both
    identified structural mutations and functionally verified their contribution
    to adaptation and speciation. Neither the theoretical arguments nor the data
    from nature, then, support the claim for a predominance of cis- regulatory
    mutations in evolution. Although this claim may be true, it is at best
    premature. Adaptation and speciation probably proceed through a combination
    of cis-regulatory and structural mutations, with a substantial contribution
    of the latter.

  abstract: >-
    A substantial number of Drosophila studies have investigated variation in
    desiccation and starvation resistance, providing an opportunity to test for
    consistent patterns of direct and correlated responses across studies and
    across the species and population levels. In general, responses to
    laboratory selection for these traits in D. melanogaster are rapid and
    indicate abundant genetic variation in populations. However, slower
    responses to selection for desiccation resistance occur in other species
    including D. simulans. Clines suggest adaptive divergence although specific
    selection pressures have not been documented empirically. Drosophila species
    differ markedly in desiccation and starvation resistance and there is also
    marked variation within species for desiccation resistance that may be
    linked to local climatic conditions. Laboratory selection experiments on
    starvation resistance in D. melanogaster suggest that changes in lipid
    content are largely responsible for resistance variation but this factor may
    be less important in explaining variation among species. For desiccation,
    lines with increased resistance show reduced rates of water loss but no
    changes in the minimum water content that flies can tolerate. Changes in
    life history traits are sometimes associated with altered levels of stress
    resistance. Increased starvation resistance is associated with longer
    development time and reduced early age reproduction in different studies.
    However, other associations are inconsistent between studies as in the case
    of stress resistance changing following selection for longevity. Multiple
    mechanisms may underlie genetic variation in stress resistance and future
    studies should address the evolutionary importance of the different
    mechanisms at the population and species levels.

  abstract: >-
    Insecticide resistance is one of the most prevalent examples of
    anthropogenic genetic change, yet our understanding of metabolic-based
    resistance remains limited by the analytical challenges associated with
    rapidly tracking the in vivo metabolites of insecticides at nonlethal doses.
    Here, using twin ion mass spectrometry analysis of the extracts of whole
    Drosophila larvae and excreta, we show that (i) eight metabolites of the
    neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, can be detected when formed by
    susceptible larval genotypes and (ii) the specific overtranscription of a
    single gene product, Cyp6g1, associated with the metabolic resistance to
    neonicotinoids, results in a significant increase in the formation of three
    imidacloprid metabolites that are formed in C-H bond activation reactions;
    that is, Cyp6g1 is directly linked to the enhanced metabolism of
    imidacloprid in vivo. These results establish a rapid and sensitive method
    for dissecting the metabolic machinery of insects by directly linking single
    gene products to insecticide metabolism.

    Wright's F-statistics, and especially FST, provide important insights into
    the evolutionary processes that influence the structure of genetic variation
    within and among populations, and they are among the most widely used
    descriptive statistics in population and evolutionary genetics. Estimates of
    FST can identify regions of the genome that have been the target of
    selection, and comparisons of FST from different parts of the genome can
    provide insights into the demographic history of populations. For these
    reasons and others, FST has a central role in population and evolutionary
    genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease
    association mapping to forensic science. This Review clarifies how FST is
    defined, how it should be estimated, how it is related to similar statistics
    and how estimates of FST should be interpreted.

    Background

    Second-generation sequencing technologies are precipitating major shifts
    with regards to what kinds of genomes are being sequenced and how they are
    annotated. While the first generation of genome projects focused on
    well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic
    organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their
    annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no
    pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders.
    Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data
    are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously
    published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of
    new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities
    presented by second-generation sequencing technologies.


    Results

    We present MAKER2, a genome annotation and data management tool designed for
    second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 is a multi-threaded, parallelized
    application that can process second-generation datasets of virtually any
    size. We show that MAKER2 can produce accurate annotations for novel genomes
    where training-data are limited, of low quality or even non-existent. MAKER2
    also provides an easy means to use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation
    quality; and it can use these data to update legacy annotations,
    significantly improving their quality. We also show that MAKER2 can evaluate
    the quality of genome annotations, and identify and prioritize problematic
    annotations for manual review.


    Conclusions

    MAKER2 is the first annotation engine specifically designed for
    second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 scales to datasets of any size,
    requires little in the way of training data, and can use mRNA-seq data to
    improve annotation quality. It can also update and manage legacy genome
    annotation datasets.

    The evolution of resistance by insect and weed pests to chemical pesticides
    is a problem of increasing importance in applied ecology. It is striking
    that the evolution of resistance by target pest species in biological
    control is much less frequently reported, particularly in control involving
    parasitoids and predators, rather than pathogens. Although it is conceivable
    that this reflects biases in reporting or frequency of application, we
    suggest that there is a puzzle here worthy of scrutiny, and we outline
    several potential underlying causes. In order of discussion (not necessarily
    of importance), these are: (1) lack of genetic variation; (2) genetic
    constraints on selection; (3) weak selection; (4) temporally varying
    selection; and (5) coevolutionary dynamics. We, in particular, focus on the
    potential for weak selection on the host for increased resistance, despite
    effective control. The very spatial mechanisms (e.g., refuges,
    metapopulation dynamics) believed to facilitate the persistence of many
    natural enemy–victim systems with strong biological control may also
    incidentally provide an environment where selection is weak on target pests
    to evolve improved resistance to control agents, thereby biasing coevolution
    toward the enemy. The basic insight is that in a spatially heterogeneous
    environment, a strong limiting factor on a population can be a weak
    selective factor. The hypotheses presented here provide ingredients needed
    to predict which biological control systems might be evolutionarily stable,
    and which not. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate more attention
    to the evolutionary dimension of biological control systems.

  abstract: >-
    Two important enzymes in metabolism of the principal neonicotinoid
    insecticide imidacloprid are liver microsomal CYP3A4 and cytosolic aldehyde
    oxidase (AOX). CYP3A4 oxidation at several molecular sites and AOX reduction
    at the nitro substituent result in either an increase (activation) or
    decrease (inactivation) of agonist potency at nicotinic acetylcholine
    receptors (nAChRs), both insect and vertebrate α4β2. This study evaluates
    activation or inactivation of 11 neonicotinoids in a continuous two-step
    system coupling metabolism and receptor binding. For metabolism, the
    neonicotinoid is incubated with CYP3A4 and NADPH or AOX with the cosubstrate
    N-methyl-nicotinamide, terminating the reaction with ketoconazole or
    menadione, respectively, to inhibit further conversion. For receptor assay,
    either the Drosophila nAChR and [3H]imidacloprid or the α4β2 nicotinic
    receptor and [3H](−)-nicotine are added to determine changes in
    neonicotinoid potency. With the Drosophila nAChR assay, the N-methyl
    compounds N-methyl-imidacloprid and thiamethoxam are activated 4.5–29-fold
    by CYP3A4 whereas nine other neonicotinoids are not changed in potency. With
    the vertebrate α4β2 nAChR, AOX enhances imidacloprid potency but CYP3A4 does
    not. The AOX system coupled with the Drosophila receptor strongly
    inactivates clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, desmethyl-thiamethoxam,
    and thiamethoxam with some inactivation of nitenpyram and nithiazine, and
    little or no effect on four other compounds.

  abstract: >-
    We report results that address a long-standing controversy in honey bee
    biology, the identity of the queen-produced compounds that inhibit worker
    honey bee ovary development. As the honey bee is the only organism for which
    identities have been proposed for any pheromone that regulates reproduction,
    the resolution of its identity is of broad significance. We examined the
    effects of synthetic honey bee queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), four newly
    identified queen retinue pheromone components, and whole-queen extracts on
    the ovary development of caged worker bees. The newly identified compounds
    did not inhibit worker ovary development alone, nor did they improve the
    efficacy of QMP when applied in combination. QMP was as effective as queen
    extracts at ovary regulation. Caged workers in the QMP and queen extract
    treatments had better developed ovaries than did workers remaining in
    queenright colonies. We conclude that QMP is responsible for the
    ovary-regulating pheromonal capability of queens from European-derived Apis
    mellifera subspecies.

  abstract: >-
    Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness,
    including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these
    interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from
    parasitoids. Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum can harbor the
    symbiotic bacteria Hamiltonella defensa and its bacteriophage APSE.
    Infection by H. defensa defends these aphids against some but not all
    parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report
    results on the effect of H. defensa on parasitism of these aphids by species
    in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, Aphelinus species in the
    family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with H. defensa/APSE by
    two Aphelinus species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While
    Aphelinus atriplicis showed no difference in fitness components between
    infected and uninfected aphids, Aphelinus glycinis actually produced more
    adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected
    aphids. Aphelinus glycinis may increase host quality for itself by changing
    the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that
    aphids infected with H. defensa can be made more suitable for parasitoid
    development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that
    these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by H. defensa/APSE that
    affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which
    may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.

    Numerous genes are involved in the regulation of plant development,
    including those that regulate floral homeotic genes, We identified two
    recessive allelic rice mutants, open beak-1 (opb-1) and opb-2, which
    exhibited pleiotropic defects in leaf morphogenesis, inflorescence
    architecture, and floral organ identity. Abnormal cell proliferation was
    observed in the leaves and spikelets, and ectopic or overexpression of
    several class 1 knox genes was detected; thus, the abnormal cell
    proliferation in opb mutants is probably caused by ectopic class 1 knox gene
    expression. The opb mutants also had defects in floral organ identity,
    resulting in the development of mosaic organs, including gluminous
    lodicules, staminoid lodicules, and pistiloid stamens. These results,
    together with the reduced expression of a class B gene, indicate that OPB
    positively regulates the expression of class B genes. Map-based cloning
    revealed that OPB encodes a transcription factor that is orthologous to the
    Arabidopsis JAGGED gene and is expressed in leaf primordia, inflorescence
    meristem, rachis branch meristems, floral meristem, and floral organ
    primordia. Taken together, our data suggest that the OPB gene affects
    cellular proliferation and floral organ identity through the regulation of
    class 1 knox genes and floral homeotic genes.

    BACKGROUND:How well does RNA-Seq data perform for quantitative whole gene
    expression analysis in the absence of a genome? This is one unanswered
    question facing the rapidly growing number of researchers studying non-model
    species. Using Homo sapiens data and resources, we compared the direct
    mapping of sequencing reads to predicted genes from the genome with mapping
    to de novo transcriptomes assembled from RNA-Seq data. Gene coverage and
    expression analysis was further investigated in the non-model context by
    using increasingly divergent genomic reference species to group assembled
    contigs by unique genes. RESULTS:Eight transcriptome sets, composed of
    varying amounts of Illumina and 454 data, were assembled and assessed.
    Hybrid 454/Illumina assemblies had the highest transcriptome and individual
    gene coverage. Quantitative whole gene expression levels were highly similar
    between using a de novo hybrid assembly and the predicted genes as a
    scaffold, although mapping to the de novo transcriptome assembly provided
    data on fewer genes. Using non-target species as reference scaffolds does
    result in some loss of sequence and expression data, and bias and error
    increase with evolutionary distance. However, within a 100 million year
    window these effect sizes are relatively small. CONCLUSIONS:Predicted gene
    sets from sequenced genomes of related species can provide a powerful method
    for grouping RNA-Seq reads and annotating contigs. Gene expression results
    can be produced that are similar to results obtained using gene models
    derived from a high quality genome, though biased towards conserved genes.
    Our results demonstrate the power and limitations of conducting RNA-Seq in
    non-model species.

  abstract: >-
    Transposon mutagenesis provides a fundamental tool for functional genomics.
    Here we present a non-species-specific, combined enhancer detection and
    binary expression system based on the transposable element piggyBac: For the
    different components of this insertional mutagenesis system, we used widely
    applicable transposons and distinguishable broad-range transformation
    markers, which should enable this system to be operational in nonmodel
    arthropods. In a pilot screen in Drosophila melanogaster, piggyBac mutator
    elements on the X chromosome were mobilized in males by a Hennes-based
    jumpstarter element providing pigpBac transposase activity under control of
    the alpha1-tubulin promoter. As primary reporters in the pigoBac mutator
    elements, we employed the heterologous transactivators GAL4Delta or tTA. To
    identify larval and adult enhancer detectors, strains carrying UASp-EYFP or
    TRE-EYFP as secondary reporter elements were used. Tissue-specific enhancer
    activities were readily observed in the GAL4Delta/UASp-based systems, but
    only rarely in the tTA/TRE system. Novel autosomal insertions were recovered
    with an average jumping rate of 80%. Of these novel insertions, 3.8% showed
    homozygous lethality, which was reversible by pigoBac excision. Insertions
    were found in both coding and noncoding regions of characterized genes and
    also in noncharacterized and non-P-targeted CG-number genes. This indicates
    that piggyBac will greatly facilitate the intended saturation mutagenesis in
    Drosophila.

  abstract: >-
    Insects perceive a large number of airborne chemicals as olfactory
    components mainly through the antenna. It is thought that detection of the
    odorants by specific receptors is followed by a degradative pathway that
    clears the olfactory organ from accumulating chemicals. In Drosophila, a
    number of P450 monooxygenases are involved in the metabolism of foreign
    chemicals [Dunkov et al. (1996)Cytochrome P450 gene cluster in Drosophila
    melanogaster, Mol. Gen. Genet. 251, 290–297]. NADPH–cytochrome P450
    oxidoreductases serve to transfer reducing equivalents to P450
    monooxygenases. We isolated cDNA and genomic clones coding for a Drosophila
    NADPH–cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR). The largest cDNA of 2471
    nucleotides in length contained an open reading frame of 693 amino acids
    that includes the putative CPR sequence. CPR is a single copy gene as shown
    by genomic Southern hybridisation and maps to the cytogenetic map position
    26C on the second chromosome. Comparison of genomic and cDNA CPR sequences
    revealed a gene structure that is split into at least six exons. The CPR
    protein sequence is almost identical with that of house fly and remarkably
    conserved when compared to vertebrates and yeast. RNA expression is high in
    embryos and antennae as compared to adult heads, adult bodies and larvae.
    High expression in antennae may reflect the putative function in olfactory
    clearance.

    The present review focuses on the expression, function and regulation of
    mouse cytochrome P450 (Cyp) enzymes. Information compiled for mouse Cyp
    enzymes is compared with data collected for human CYP enzymes. To date,
    approximately 40 pairs of orthologous mouse-human CYP genes have been
    identified that encode enzymes performing similar metabolic functions.
    Recent knowledge concerning the tissue expression of mouse Cyp enzymes from
    families 1 to 51 is summarized. The catalytic activities of microsomal,
    mitochondrial and recombinant mouse Cyp enzymes are discussed and their
    involvement in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous compounds is
    highlighted. The role of nuclear receptors, such as the aryl hydrocarbon
    receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor, in
    regulating the expression of mouse Cyp enzymes is examined. Targeted
    disruption of selected Cyp genes has generated numerous Cyp null mouse lines
    used to decipher the role of Cyp enzymes in metabolic, toxicological and
    biological processes. In conclusion, the laboratory mouse is an
    indispensable model for exploring human CYP-mediated activities.

  abstract: "The effect of diet on reproduction is well documented in a large number of organisms; however, much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanisms underlying this connection. The Drosophila ovary has a well described, fast and largely reversible response to diet. Ovarian stem cells and their progeny proliferate and grow faster on a yeast-rich diet than on a yeast-free (poor) diet, and death of early germline cysts, degeneration of early vitellogenic follicles and partial block in ovulation further contribute to the ∼60-fold decrease in egg laying observed on a poor diet. Multiple diet-dependent factors, including insulin-like peptides, the steroid ecdysone, the nutrient sensor Target of Rapamycin, AMP-dependent kinase, and adipocyte factors mediate this complex response. Here, we describe the results of a visual screen using a collection of green fluorescent protein (GFP) protein trap lines to identify additional factors potentially involved in this response. In each GFP protein trap line, an artificial GFP exon is fused in frame to an endogenous protein, such that the GFP fusion pattern parallels the levels and subcellular localization of the corresponding native protein. We identified 53 GFP-tagged proteins that exhibit changes in levels and/or subcellular localization in the ovary at 12–16\_hours after switching females from rich to poor diets, suggesting them as potential candidates for future functional studies."

  abstract: >-
    Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the wild relative of Asian cultivated
    rice (Oryza sativa), flaunts long, barbed awns, which are necessary for
    efficient propagation and dissemination of seeds. By contrast, O. sativa
    cultivars have been selected to be awnless or to harbor short, barbless
    awns, which facilitate seed processing and storage. The transition from
    long, barbed awns to short, barbless awns was a crucial event in rice
    domestication. Here, we show that the presence of long, barbed awns in wild
    rice is controlled by a major gene on chromosome 4, LONG AND BARBED AWN1
    (LABA1), which encodes a cytokinin-activating enzyme. A frame-shift deletion
    in LABA1 of cultivated rice reduces the cytokinin concentration in awn
    primordia, disrupting barb formation and awn elongation. Sequencing analysis
    demonstrated low nucleotide diversity and a selective sweep encompassing an
    ∼800-kb region around the derived laba1 allele in cultivated rice. Haplotype
    analysis revealed that the laba1 allele originated in the japonica
    subspecies and moved into the indica gene pool via introgression, suggesting
    that humans selected for this locus in early rice domestication.
    Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and
    also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development.

  abstract: >-
    In the Arabidopsis multiparent recombinant inbred line mapping population, a
    limited number of plants were detected that lacked axillary buds in most of
    the axils of the cauline (stem) leaves, but formed such buds in almost all
    rosette axils. Genetic analysis showed that polymorphisms in at least three
    loci together constitute this phenotype, which only occurs in late-flowering
    plants. Early flowering is epistatic to two of these loci, called REDUCED
    SHOOT BRANCHING1 (RSB1) and RSB2, which themselves do not affect flowering
    time. Map-based cloning and confirmation by transformation with genes from
    the region where RSB1 was identified by fine-mapping showed that a specific
    allele of AGAMOUS-Like6 from accession C24 conferred reduced branching in
    the cauline leaves. Site-directed mutagenesis in the Columbia allele
    revealed the causal amino acid substitution, which behaved as dominant
    negative, as was concluded from a loss-of-function mutation that showed the
    same phenotype in the late-flowering genetic background. This causal allele
    occurs at a frequency of 15% in the resequenced Arabidopsis thaliana
    accessions and correlated with reduced stem branching only in late-flowering
    accessions. The data show the importance of natural variation and epistatic
    interactions in revealing gene function.

    Uncovering the genetic basis of agronomic traits in crop landraces that have
    adapted to various agro-climatic conditions is important to world food
    security. Here we have identified ∼ 3.6 million SNPs by sequencing 517 rice
    landraces and constructed a high-density haplotype map of the rice genome
    using a novel data-imputation method. We performed genome-wide association
    studies (GWAS) for 14 agronomic traits in the population of Oryza sativa
    indica subspecies. The loci identified through GWAS explained ∼ 36% of the
    phenotypic variance, on average. The peak signals at six loci were tied
    closely to previously identified genes. This study provides a fundamental
    resource for rice genetics research and breeding, and demonstrates that an
    approach integrating second-generation genome sequencing and GWAS can be
    used as a powerful complementary strategy to classical biparental
    cross-mapping for dissecting complex traits in rice.

    SummaryDe novo assembly is a difficult issue for heterozygous diploid
    genomes. The advent of high-throughput short-read and long-read sequencing
    technologies provides both new challenges and potential solutions to the
    issue. Here, we present HaploMerger2 (HM2), an automated pipeline for
    rebuilding both haploid sub-assemblies from the polymorphic diploid genome
    assembly. It is designed to work on pre-existing diploid assemblies, which
    are typically created by using de novo assemblers. HM2 can process any
    diploid assemblies, but it is especially suitable for diploid assemblies
    with high heterozygosity (≥3%), which can be difficult for other tools. This
    pipeline also implements flexible and sensitive assembly error detection, a
    hierarchical scaffolding procedure and a reliable gap-closing method for
    haploid sub-assemblies. Using HM2, we demonstrate that two haploid
    sub-assemblies reconstructed from a real, highly-polymorphic diploid
    assembly show greatly improved continuity.Availability and

    Crop domestications are long-term selection experiments that have greatly
    advanced human civilization. The domestication of cultivated rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) ranks as one of the most important developments in history.
    However, its origins and domestication processes are controversial and have
    long been debated. Here we generate genome sequences from 446 geographically
    diverse accessions of the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon, the immediate
    ancestral progenitor of cultivated rice, and from 1,083 cultivated indica
    and japonica varieties to construct a comprehensive map of rice genome
    variation. In the search for signatures of selection, we identify 55
    selective sweeps that have occurred during domestication. In-depth analyses
    of the domestication sweeps and genome-wide patterns reveal that Oryza
    sativa japonica rice was first domesticated from a specific population of O.
    rufipogon around the middle area of the Pearl River in southern China, and
    that Oryza sativa indica rice was subsequently developed from crosses
    between japonica rice and local wild rice as the initial cultivars spread
    into South East and South Asia. The domestication-associated traits are
    analysed through high-resolution genetic mapping. This study provides an
    important resource for rice breeding and an effective genomics approach for
    crop domestication research.

    Four glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) isozymes have been
    characterized in the larvae of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella
    xylostella L., a cosmopolitan insect pest of crucifiers. This work aimed at
    cloning and heterologously expressing the cDNA of DBM GST-3, an isozyme
    involved in this insect resistance to some organophosphorus insecticides,
    and studying the molecular basis for its increased expression in the
    resistant strains. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
    using midgut mRNA from a methyl parathion resistant MPA strain and
    degenerate primers complimentary to the N-terminal and internal amino acid
    sequences of GST-3 generated a 128 bp DNA product. A clone of 809 bp,
    obtained by screening a midgut cDNA library of MPA strain using this PCR
    product as probe, encoded a protein of 216 amino acids (calculated Mr 24,083
    and pI 8.50). This GST of DBM, PxGST3, shared the highest (46.3%) amino acid
    sequence identity, among insects, to MsGST1 of Manduca sexta. PxGST3 mRNA
    level was considerably higher in MPA than in susceptible strains, and
    Southern blots suggested that gene amplifi cation was probably not involved
    in the increased expression of this GST isozyme. Enzymatically active PxGST3
    expressed heterologously in E. coli exhibited similar biochemical and
    toxicological properties as GST-3 purified from DBM larvae. It is the first
    cloned GST with a well-defined role in insecticide resistance. (C) 1998

    Grain yield is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from
    natural variations in many crop plants. Here we report the molecular
    characterization of a major rice grain yield QTL that acts through the
    determination of panicle architecture. The dominant allele at the DEP1 locus
    is a gain-of-function mutation causing truncation of a
    phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein-like domain protein. The effect of
    this allele is to enhance meristematic activity, resulting in a reduced
    length of the inflorescence internode, an increased number of grains per
    panicle and a consequent increase in grain yield. This allele is common to
    many Chinese high-yielding rice varieties and likely represents a relatively
    recent introduction into the cultivated rice gene pool. We also show that a
    functionally equivalent allele is present in the temperate cereals and seems
    to have arisen before the divergence of the wheat and barley lineages.

    Imprinted macro non-protein-coding (nc) RNAs are cis-repressor transcripts
    that silence multiple genes in at least three imprinted gene clusters in the
    mouse genome. Similar macro or long ncRNAs are abundant in the mammalian
    genome. Here we present the full coding and non-coding transcriptome of two
    mouse tissues: differentiated ES cells and fetal head using an optimized
    RNA-Seq strategy. The data produced is highly reproducible in different
    sequencing locations and is able to detect the full length of imprinted
    macro ncRNAs such as Airn and Kcnq1ot1, whose length ranges between 80-118
    kb. Transcripts show a more uniform read coverage when RNA is fragmented
    with RNA hydrolysis compared with cDNA fragmentation by shearing.
    Irrespective of the fragmentation method, all coding and non-coding
    transcripts longer than 8 kb show a gradual loss of sequencing tags towards
    the 3' end. Comparisons to published RNA-Seq datasets show that the strategy
    presented here is more efficient in detecting known functional imprinted
    macro ncRNAs and also indicate that standardization of RNA preparation
    protocols would increase the comparability of the transcriptome between
    different RNA-Seq datasets.

    DAVID bioinformatics resources consists of an integrated biological
    knowledgebase and analytic tools aimed at systematically extracting
    biological meaning from large gene/protein lists. This protocol explains how
    to use DAVID, a high-throughput and integrated data-mining environment, to
    analyze gene lists derived from high-throughput genomic experiments. The
    procedure first requires uploading a gene list containing any number of
    common gene identifiers followed by analysis using one or more text and
    pathway-mining tools such as gene functional classification, functional
    annotation chart or clustering and functional annotation table. By following
    this protocol, investigators are able to gain an in-depth understanding of
    the biological themes in lists of genes that are enriched in genome-scale
    studies.

    Inflorescence branching is a key agronomical trait determining rice yield.
    The ancestral wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) primary branch bears few
    grains due to minimal secondary branching. By contrast, O. sativa cultivars
    have been selected to produce large panicles with more secondary branches.
    Here we showed that the CONTROL OF SECONDARY BRANCH 1 (COS1) gene, which is
    identical to FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP), plays an important role in the key
    transition from few secondary branches of wild rice to more secondary
    branches in domesticated rice cultivars. A 4-bp tandem repeat deletion in
    2.7-kb upstream of FZP may affect the binding activities of Auxin Response
    Factors (OsARFs) to the FZP promoter, decrease FZP expression level, and
    significantly enhance secondary branch number and grain yields in cultivated
    rice. Functional analyses showed that NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), a trypsin-like
    serine and cysteine protease, interacted with FZP and promoted FZP
    degradation. Consistently, down-regulating FZP expression or up-regulating
    NAL1 expression in commercial cultivar Zhonghua 17 increased secondary
    branches per panicle, grain number per panicle, and grain yield per plant.
    Our findings not only provide insights into the molecular mechanism of
    increasing grain number and yield during rice domestication, but also offer
    favorable genes for grain yield improvement of rice. This article is

    Consumers expect organic products to be healthier. However, limited research
    has been performed to study the effect of organic food on health. The
    present study aimed to identify biomarkers of health to enable future
    studies in human subjects. A feeding experiment was performed in two
    generations of three groups of chickens differing in immune responsiveness,
    which were fed identically composed feeds from either organic or
    conventional produce. The animals of the second generation were exposed to
    an immune challenge and sacriticed at 13 weeks of age. Feed and ingredients
    were analysed on macro- and micronutrients , i.e. vitamins, minerals,
    genomics and post-mortem evaluation. The organic and conventional feeds were
    comparable with respect of metabolisable energy. On average, the
    conventionally produced feeds had a 10 % higher protein content and some
    differences in micronutrients were observed. Although animals on both feeds
    were health, differences between the groups were found. The random control
    group of chickens fed conventional feed showed overall a higher weight gain
    during life span than the group on organic feed, although feed intake was
    mostly comparable. The animals on organic feed showed an enhanced immune
    reactivity, a stronger reaction to the immune challenge as well as a
    slightly stronger 'catch-up growth' after the challenge. Biomarkers for
    future research were identified in the parameters feed intake, body weight
    and growth rate, and in immunological, physiological and metabolic
    parameters, several of these differing most pronounced after the challenge.

    With the available eukaryotic genome sequences, there are predictions of
    thousands of previously uncharacterized genes without known function or
    available mutational variant. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficient
    genetic tools for genomewide phenotypic analysis. Here we describe such a
    tool: a deletion-generator technology that exploits properties of a double
    transposable element to produce molecularly defined deletions at high
    density and with high efficiency. This double element, called PwHy, is
    composed of a "deleter" element hobo, bracketed by two genetic markers and
    inserted into a "carrier" P element. We have used this PwHy element in
    Drosophila melanogaster to generate sets of nested deletions of sufficient
    coverage to discriminate among every transcription unit within 60 kb of the
    starting insertion site. Because these two types of mobile elements, carrier
    and deleter, can be found in other species, our strategy should be
    applicable to phenotypic analysis in a variety of model organisms.

  abstract: >-
    Anomalous flowering of the Antirrhinum majus mutant squamosa (squa) is
    characterized by excessive formation of bracts and the production of
    relatively few and often malformed or incomplete flowers. To study the
    function of squamosa in the commitment of an inflorescence lateral meristem
    to floral development, the gene was cloned and its genomic structure, a well
    as that of four mutant alleles, was determined. SQUA is a member of a family
    of transcription factors which contain the MADS-box, a conserved DNA binding
    domain. In addition, we analysed the temporal and spatial expression pattern
    of the squa gene. Low transcriptional activity of squa is detectable in
    bracts and in the leaves immediately below the inflorescence. High squa
    transcript levels are seen in the inflorescence lateral meristems as soon as
    they are formed in the axils of bracts. Squa transcriptional activity
    persists through later stages of floral morphogenesis, with the exception of
    stamen differentiation. Although necessary for shaping a normal racemose
    inflorescence, the squa function is not absolutely essential for flower
    development. We discuss the function of the gene during flowering, its
    likely functional redundancy and its possible interaction with other genes
    participating in the genetic control of flower formation in Antirrhinum.

    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases play critical roles in the detoxification of
    linear and angular furanocoumarins present in the host plants of Papilio
    polyxenes (black swallowtail) larvae. To determine the spectrum of linear
    and angular furanocoumarins that induce isozymes responsible for these
    detoxifications, the metabolic activities of individual P. polyxenes larvae
    were monitored in response to individual furanocoumarins. Two linear
    furanocoumarins, xanthotoxin and bergapten, as well as the angular
    furanocoumarin, angelicin, significantly and selectively induce metabolism
    of several furanocoumarins. Another angular furanocoumarin, sphondin, does
    not induce furanocoumarin metabolism even though it is itself capable of
    being metabolized in vivo. Northern analysis of the mRNAs induced in
    response to each of four naturally occurring furanocoumarins indicates that
    mRNAs related to CYP6B1 are highly induced by the two linear furanocoumarins
    (xanthotoxin, bergapten) and by angelicin, the angular furanocoumarin. RNase
    protection analysis indicates that CYP6B1v1-3 transcripts, which we have
    already cloned, are specifically induced by xanthotoxin and that additional
    CYP6B1-related transcripts are induced in response to angelicin, These data
    indicate that a complex array of CYP6B1 transcripts, derived from a minimum
    of two loci, is responsible for furanocoumarin metabolism in P. polyxenes.
    Transcripts derived from these loci appear to be differentially induced by
    linear and angular furanocoumarins.

    In animals, the double-stranded RNA-specific endonuclease Dicer produces two
    classes of functionally distinct, tiny RNAs: microRNAs ( miRNAs) and small
    interfering RNAs (siRNAs). miRNAs regulate mRNA translation, whereas siRNAs
    direct RNA destruction via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Here we show
    that, in human cell extracts, the miRNA let-7 naturally enters the RNAi
    pathway, which suggests that only the degree of complementarity between a
    miRNA and its RNA target determines its function. Human let-7 is a component
    of a previously identified, miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particle,
    which we show is an RNAi enzyme complex. Each let-7 containing complex
    directs multiple rounds of RNA cleavage, which explains the remarkable
    efficiency of the RNAi pathway in human cells.

    Showing which genes are expressed, or switched on, in individual cells may
    help to reveal the first signs of disease. Each cell in an organism contains
    the same genetic information, but cell type and behavior depend on which
    genes are expressed. Previously, researchers could only sequence cells in
    batches, averaging the results, but technological improvements now allow
    sequencing of the genes expressed in an individual cell, known as
    single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Ji Hyun Lee (Kyung Hee University,
    Seoul) and Duhee Bang and Byungjin Hwang (Yonsei University, Seoul) have
    reviewed the available scRNA-seq technologies and the strategies available
    to analyze the large quantities of data produced. They conclude that
    scRNA-seq will impact both basic and medical science, from illuminating drug
    resistance in cancer to revealing the complex pathways of cell
    differentiation during development.

    Human P450 2C19 is selective for 4'-hydroxylation of S-mephenytoin and
    5-hydroxylation of omeprazole, while the structurally homologous P450 2C9
    has low activity toward these substrates. To identify the critical amino
    acids that determine the specificity of human P450 2C19, we constructed
    chimeras of P450 2C9 replacing various proposed substrate binding sites
    (SRS) with those of P450 2C19 and then replaced individual residues of P450
    2C9 by site directed mutagenesis. The 339 NH2-terminal amino acid residues
    (SRS-1–SRS-4) and amino acids 160-383 (SRS-2–SRS-5) of P450 2C19 conferred
    omeprazole 5-hydroxylase activity to P450 2C9. In contrast, the COOH
    terminus of P450 2C19 (residues 340-490 including SRS-5 and SRS-6), residues
    228-339 (SRS-3 and SRS-4) and residues 292-383 (part of SRS-4 and SRS-B)
    conferred only modest increases in activity. A single mutation Ile(99) –>
    His increased omeprazole 5-hydroxylase to similar to 51% of that of P450
    2C19. A chimera spanning residues 160-227 of P450 2C19 also exhibited
    omeprazole 5-hydroxylase activity which was dramatically enhanced by the
    mutation Ile(99) –> His, A combination of two mutations, Ile(99) –> His and
    Ser(200) –> Pro, converted P450 2C9 to an enzyme with a turnover number for
    omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, which resembled that of P450 2C19. Mutation of
    Pro(221) –> Thr enhanced this activity. Residue 99 is within SRS-1, but
    amino acids 220 and 221 are in the F-G loop and outside any known SRS.
    Mutation of these three amino acids did not confer significant S-mephenytoin
    5-hydroxylase activity to P450 2C9, although chimeras containing SRS-1–SRS-4
    and SRS-2–SRS-5 of P450 2C19 exhibited activity toward this substrate. Our
    results thus indicate that amino acids 99, 220, and 221 are key residues
    that determine the specificity of P450 2C19 for omeprazole.

    loss of floral meristem determinacy. Map-based cloning revealed that APO2 is
    identical to previously reported RFL gene, the rice ortholog of the
    Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) gene. Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and
    APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act
    cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development. The present
    study revealed functional differences between APO2/RFL and LFY. In
    particular, APO2/RFL and LFY act oppositely on inflorescence development.
    Therefore, the genetic mechanisms for controlling inflorescence architecture
    have evolutionarily diverged between rice (monocots) and Arabidopsis
    (eudicots).

    Breeding of high-yielding rice is crucial for meeting the food demand of the
    increasing world population. New technologies have facilitated
    identification of genes involved in quantitative traits, and many genes
    underpinning quantitative trait loci involved in rice crop yield have been
    isolated. Meanwhile, various kinds of mutants have been intensively studied,
    leading to characterization of many genes related to yield traits. A
    combination of quantitative trait locus analysis and studies of such mutants
    has made it possible to compile a list of genes available for breeding rice
    with higher yield.

    Inflorescence architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits.
    Characterization of rice aberrant panicle organization 1 (apo1) mutants
    revealed that APO1 positively controls spikelet number by suppressing the
    precocious conversion of inflorescence meristems to spikelet meristems. In
    addition, APO1 is associated with the regulation of the plastchron, floral
    organ identity, and floral determinacy. Phenotypic analyses of apo1 and
    floral homeotic double mutants demonstrate that APO1 positively regulates
    class-C floral homeotic genes, but not class-B genes. Molecular studies
    revealed that APO1 encodes an F-box protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis
    UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO), which is a positive regulator of class-B genes.
    Overexpression of APO1 caused an increase in inflorescence branches and
    spikelets. As the mutant inflorescences and flowers differed considerably
    between apo1 and ufo, the functions of APO1 and UFO appear to have diverged
    during evolution.

    The rice slender mutant (slr1-1) is caused by a single recessive mutation
    and results in a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype. The
    mutant elongates as if saturated with GAs. In this mutant, (1) elongation
    was unaffected by an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, (2) GA-inducible
    alpha-amylase was produced by the aleurone layers without gibberellic acid
    application, and (3) endogenous GA content was lower than in the wild-type
    plant. These results indicate that the product of the SLR1 gene is an
    intermediate of the GA signal transduction pathway. SLR1 maps to OsGAI in
    rice and has significant homology with height-regulating genes, such as
    RHT-1Da in wheat, D8 in maize, and GAI and RGA in Arabidopsis. The GAI gene
    family is likely to encode transcriptional factors belonging to the GRAS
    gene superfamily. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the slr1-1 mutation is
    a single basepair deletion of the nuclear localization signal domain,
    resulting in a frameshift mutation that abolishes protein production.
    Furthermore, introduction of a 6-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the
    wild-type SLR1 gene into the slr1-1 mutant restored GA sensitivity to
    normal. These results indicate that the slr1-1 mutant is caused by a
    loss-of-function mutation of the SLR1 gene, which is an ortholog of GAI,
    RGA, RHT, and D8. We also succeeded in producing GA-insensitive dwarf rice
    by transforming wild-type rice with a modified SLR1 gene construct that has
    a 17-amino acid deletion affecting the DELLA region. Thus, we demonstrate
    opposite GA response phenotypes depending on the type of mutations in SLR1.

  abstract: >-
    Multiple assays are available to measure P450 activity in insects, including
    mosquitoes; however, each of these assays has drawbacks in terms of the
    number of mosquitoes required, specificity, sensitivity, cost, and/or time
    required to prepare active enzyme homogenates. In this study, a commercially
    available luminescent assay, P450-Glo, was modified and evaluated to measure
    P450 activity from the gut of a single larva after removal of the gut
    contents. We also compared this assay to all earlier developed fluorescent
    assay. After optimization of assay conditions, the P450-Glo assay held
    considerable promise to be used as all effective, inexpensive,
    high-throughput, and sensitive screening assay to measure P450 activities in
    single mosquitoes. Furthermore, we tested the utility of the single gut
    assay using the pyrethroid resistant Marin strain of Cidex pipiens pipiens
    form molestus and the pyrethroid sensitive CQ-1 strain of Cx. pipiens
    quinqefasciatus. We observed on average 1.8-fold higher levels of P450
    activity in the resistant mosquitoes in comparison to the sensitive
    mosquitoes. Additionally, consistent with our previous findings,
    distribution plots of P450 activity showed 33% of individual Marin
    Mosquitoes had higher P450 activities than the highest activity displayed by
    a CQ-1. mosquito. The assay platform is highly flexible ill terms of choice
    of tissue, method of preparation, isozyme specificity, and sample quantity
    and thus could easily be adapted to be used for other arthropod species.

    Odorant-degrading enzymes have been postulated to participate in the fast
    deactivation of insect pheromones. These proteins are expressed specifically
    in the sensillar lymph of insect antennae in such low amounts that,
    hitherto, isolation and protein-based cDNA cloning has not been possible.
    Using degenerate primers based on conserved amino acid sequences of insect
    carboxylesterases and juvenile hormone esterases, we were able to amplify
    partial cDNA fragments, which were then used for the design of gene-specific
    primers for RACE. This bioinformatics approach led us to the cloning of
    cDNAs, encoding a putative odorant-degrading enzyme (Apol-ODE) and a
    putative integumental esterase (Apol-IE) from the wild silkmoth, Antheraea
    polyphemus. Apol-ODE had a predicted molecular mass of 59,994 Da, pI of
    6.63, three potential N-glycosylation sites, and a putative catalytic site
    Ser characterized by the sequence Gly(195)-Glu-Ser-Ala-Gly-Ala. Apol-IE gave
    calculated molecular mass of 61,694 Da, pI of 7.49, two potential
    N-glycosylation sites, and a putative active site with the sequence
    Gly(214)-Tyr-Ser-Ala-Gly. The transcript of Apol-ODE was detected by RT-PCR
    in male antennae and branches (sensillar tissues), but not in female
    antennae and other control tissues. Apol-IE was detected in male and female
    antennae as well as legs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

    We have isolated, cloned, and expressed a male antennae-specific
    pheromone-degrading enzyme (PDE) [Antheraea polyphemus PDE (ApolPDE),
    formerly known as Sensillar Esterase] from the wild silkmoth, A. polyphemus,
    which seems essential for the rapid inactivation of pheromone during flight.
    The onset of enzymatic activity was detected at day 13 of the pupal stage
    with a peak at day 2 adult stage. De novo sequencing of ApolPDE, isolated
    from day 2 male antennae by multiple chromatographic steps, led to cDNA
    cloning. Purified recombinant ApolPDE, expressed by baculovirus, migrated
    with the same mobility as the native protein on both native polyacrylamide
    and isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis. Concentration of ApolPDE (0.5
    mu M) in the sensillar lymph is approximate to 20,000 lower than that of a
    pheromone-binding protein. Native and recombinant ApolPDE showed comparable
    kinetic parameters, with turnover number similar to that of carboxypeptidase
    and substrate specificity slightly lower than that of acetylcholinesterase.
    The rapid inactivation of pheromone, even faster than previously estimated,
    is kinetically compatible with the temporal resolution required for
    sustained odorant-mediated flight in moths.

    Much attention has focused on the aetiology of oxidative damage in cellular
    and organismal ageing(1-4). Especially toxic are the reactive oxygen
    byproducts of respiration and other biological processes(5). A mev-1(kn1)
    mutant of Caenorhabditis elegans has been found to be hypersensitive to
    raised oxygen concentrations(6,7), Unlike the wild type, its lifespan
    decreases dramatically as oxygen concentrations are increased from 1 tee 60%
    (ref. 7). Strains bearing this mutation accumulate markers of ageing (such
    as fluorescent materials and protein carbonyls) faster than the wild
    type(8,9). We show here that mev-1 encodes a subunit of the enzyme succinate
    dehydrogenase cytochrome b, which is a component of complex II of the
    mitochondrial electron transport chain. We found that the ability of complex
    II to catalyse electron transport from succinate to ubiquinone is
    compromised in mev-l animals. This may cause an indirect increase in
    superoxide levels, which in turn leads to oxygen hypersensitivity and
    premature ageing. Our results indicate that mev-1 governs the rate of ageing
    by modulating the cellular response to oxidative stress.

  abstract: >-
    Electrophile responsive element (EpRE)-mediated gene induction is a pivotal
    mechanism of cellular defense against the toxicity of electrophiles and
    reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nrf2, which belongs to the cap'-n'-collar
    family of basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors, has emerged as
    an essential component of an EpRE-binding transcriptional complex. Detailed
    analysis of the regulatory mechanism governing Nrf2 activity led to the
    identification of Keap1, which represses Nrf2 activity by directly binding
    to the N-terminal Neh2 domain. Keap1 interaction with Neh2 leads to the
    sequestration of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and to the enhancement of Nrf2
    degradation by proteasomes conferring tight regulation on the response.
    Electrophiles act to counteract sequestration of Nrf2 by Keap1 and provoke
    Nrf2 activation. Constitutive activation of Nrf2-regulated transcription in
    Keap1 knockout mice clearly demonstrated that the disruption of Keap1
    repression is sufficient for the activation of Nrf2. These observations
    indicated that the mechanism that modulates Nrf2-Keap1 interaction is
    pivotal for the cellular sensing mechanism for electrophiles. Recent
    analyses argue that the redox mechanism that modifies cysteine residues of
    Keap1 governs the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and therefore is critical for
    sensing of electrophiles.

  abstract: >-
    Phyllotaxy is defined as the spatial arrangement of leaves on the stem. The
    mechanism responsible for this extremely regular pattern is one of the most
    fascinating enigmas in plant biology. In this study, we identified a gene
    regulating the phyllotactic pattern in rice. Loss-of-function mutants of the
    DECUSSATE (DEC) gene displayed a phyllotactic conversion from normal
    distichous pattern to decussate. The dec mutants had an enlarged shoot
    apical meristem with enhanced cell division activity. In contrast to the
    shoot apical meristem, the size of the root apical meristem in the dec
    mutants was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed. These
    phenotypes indicate that DEC has opposite functions in the shoot apical
    meristem and root apical meristem. Map-based cloning revealed that DEC
    encodes a plant-specific protein containing a glutamine-rich region and a
    conserved motif. Although its molecular function is unclear, the conserved
    domain is shared with fungi and animals. Expression analysis showed that
    several type A response regulator genes that act in the cytokinin signaling
    pathway were down-regulated in the dec mutant. In addition, dec seedlings
    showed a reduced responsiveness to exogenous cytokinin. Our results suggest
    that DEC controls the phyllotactic pattern by affecting cytokinin signaling
    in rice.

    Insect carboxylesterases from the αEsterase gene cluster, such as αE7 (also
    known as E3) from the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina (LcαE7), play
    an important physiological role in lipid metabolism and are implicated in
    the detoxification of organophosphate (OP) insecticides. Despite the
    importance of OPs to agriculture and the spread of insect-borne diseases,
    the molecular basis for the ability of α-carboxylesterases to confer OP
    resistance to insects is poorly understood. In this work, we used laboratory
    evolution to increase the thermal stability of LcαE7, allowing its
    overexpression in Escherichia coli and structure determination. The crystal
    structure reveals a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold that is very similar to the
    primary target of OPs (acetylcholinesterase) and a unique N-terminal α-helix
    that serves as a membrane anchor. Soaking of LcαE7 crystals in OPs led to
    the capture of a crystallographic snapshot of LcαE7 in its phosphorylated
    state, which allowed comparison with acetylcholinesterase and
    rationalization of its ability to protect insects against the effects of
    OPs. Finally, inspection of the active site of LcαE7 reveals an asymmetric
    and hydrophobic substrate binding cavity that is well-suited to fatty acid
    methyl esters, which are hydrolyzed by the enzyme with specificity constants
    (∼10(6) M(-1) s(-1)) indicative of a natural substrate.

  abstract: >-
    Low environmental temperature and dietary restriction (DR) extend lifespan
    in diverse organisms. In the fruit fly Drosophila, switching flies between
    temperatures alters the rate at which mortality subsequently increases with
    age but does not reverse mortality rate. In contrast, DR acts acutely to
    lower mortality risk; flies switched between control feeding and DR show a
    rapid reversal of mortality rate. Dietary restriction thus does not slow
    accumulation of aging-related damage. Molecular species that track the
    effects of temperatures on mortality but are unaltered with switches in diet
    are therefore potential biomarkers of aging-related damage. However,
    molecular species that switch upon instigation or withdrawal of DR are thus
    potential biomarkers of mechanisms underlying risk of mortality, but not of
    aging-related damage. Using this approach, we assessed several commonly used
    biomarkers of aging-related damage. Accumulation of fluorescent advanced
    glycation end products (AGEs) correlated strongly with mortality rate of
    flies at different temperatures but was independent of diet. Hence,
    fluorescent AGEs are biomarkers of aging-related damage in flies. In
    contrast, five oxidized and glycated protein adducts accumulated with age,
    but were reversible with both temperature and diet, and are therefore not
    markers either of acute risk of dying or of aging-related damage. Our
    approach provides a powerful method for identification of biomarkers of
    aging.

    Morphogenetic fields are among the most fundamental concepts of embryology.
    However, they are also among the most ill-defined, since they consist of
    dynamic regulatory processes whose exact nature remains elusive. In order to
    achieve a more rigorous definition of a developmental field, Lewis Wolpert
    introduced the concept of positional information illustrated by his French
    Flag model. Here we argue that Wolpert's positional information - a static
    coordinate system defining a field - lacks essential properties of the
    original field concept. We show how data-driven mathematical modeling
    approaches now enable us to study regulatory processes in a way that is
    qualitatively different from our previous level of understanding. As an
    example, we review our recent analysis of segmentation gene expression in
    the blastoderm embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Based on
    this analysis, we propose a revised French Flag, which incorporates the
    dynamic, feedback-driven nature of pattern formation in the Drosophila
    blastoderm.

    Plant hormones play a major role in plant growth and development. They
    affect similar processes but, paradoxically, their signaling pathways act
    nonredundantly. Hormone signals are integrated at the gene-network level
    rather than by cross-talk during signal transduction. In contrast to
    hormone-hormone integration, recent data suggest that light and plant
    hormone pathways share common signaling components, which allows
    photoreceptors to influence the growth program. We propose a role for the
    plant hormone auxin as an integrator of the activities of multiple plant
    hormones to control plant growth in response to the environment.

    Auxin regulates plant growth and development by altering the expression of
    diverse genes. Among these, the genes of Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH3 classes have
    been extensively studied in dicots, but little information is available on
    monocots. We have identified 12 members of GH3 gene family in rice using
    sequences of full-length cDNA clones available from KOME and analysis of the
    whole genome sequence of rice. The genomic organization as well as
    chromosomal location of all the OsGH3 genes is reported. The rice GH3
    proteins can be classified in two groups (groups I and II) on the basis of
    their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis GH3 proteins. Based upon
    the sequences available in the database, not a single group III GH3 protein
    could be identified in rice. An extensive survey of EST sequences of other
    monocots led to the conclusion that although GH3 gene family is highly
    conserved in both dicots and monocots but the group III is conspicuous by
    its absence in monocots. The in silico analysis has been complemented with
    experimental data to quantify transcript levels of all GH3 gene family
    members. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the organ-specific
    expression of individual OsGH3 genes in light- and dark-grown
    seedlings/plants has been examined. The transcript abundance of nearly all
    OsGH3 genes is enhanced on auxin treatment, with the effect more pronounced
    on OsGH3-1, -2, and -4. The functional validation of these genes in
    transgenics or analysis of gene-specific insertional mutants will help in
    elucidating their precise role in auxin signal transduction.

    Homeobox genes play a critical role in regulating various aspects of plant
    growth and development. In the present study, we identified a total of 107
    homeobox genes in the rice genome and grouped them into ten distinct
    subfamilies based upon their domain composition and phylogenetic analysis. A
    significantly large number of homeobox genes are located in the duplicated
    segments of the rice genome, which suggests that the expansion of homeobox
    gene family, in large part, might have occurred due to segmental
    duplications in rice. Furthermore, microarray analysis was performed to
    elucidate the expression profiles of these genes in different tissues and
    during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development. Several
    genes with predominant expression during various stages of panicle and seed
    development were identified. At least 37 homeobox genes were found to be
    differentially expressed significantly (more than two-fold; P < 0.05) under
    various abiotic stress conditions. The results of the study suggest a
    critical role of homeobox genes in reproductive development and abiotic
    stress signaling in rice, and will facilitate the selection of candidate
    genes of agronomic importance for functional validation.

  abstract: >-
    Plants raised under field conditions are acclimated to ambient levels of
    solar UV-B radiation. Morphogenic responses are part of the UV-B acclimation
    process and have been hypothesized to contribute to UV avoidance. UV-B
    induced morphogenic responses include inhibition of hypocotyl and stem
    elongation, leaf curling, leaf thickening and increased axillary branching.
    So far, neither the photosensory nor the signal transduction mechanism
    involved in UV-B mediated morphogenesis has been identified. The combination
    of classical photobiological techniques and Arabidopsis genetic resources
    comprises a powerful tool for the analysis of morphogenic responses.
    However, no morphogenic mutants, specifically altered in their response to
    UV-B, have yet been identified. In this paper we discuss the possibility
    that some UV-B driven morphogenic responses do not involve a dedicated
    photosensory system, but rather are a consequence of UV-B induced changes in
    secondary metabolism. UV-B induced flavonoid aglycones and phenol-oxidizing
    peroxidases can affect, respectively, polar auxin transport and auxin
    catabolism, and hence plant architecture. Integration of genetic,
    photobiological, biochemical and physiological approaches is necessary to
    fully appraise the ecophysiological role of UV-B radiation in controlling
    plant architecture.

  abstract: >-
    Low levels of ultraviolet (UV)-radiation alter the morphology of plants.
    UV-B exposure can lead to shorter petioles and shorter, narrower and/or
    thicker leaf blades. The resulting decrease in leaf area has been associated
    with inhibitory UV-B effects on biomass accumulation. In Arabidopsis, UV-B
    effects on leaf area have variously been attributed to altered cell
    division, cell expansion or combinations of these two processes. A dedicated
    UV-B sensory system, crosstalk between flavonoids and auxins,
    endoreduplication and generic Stress Induced Morphogenic Responses (SIMR)
    have all been proposed to contribute to the UV-B phenotype. Here, we propose
    that UV-mediated morphogenesis, rather than being controlled by a single
    regulatory pathway, is controlled by a regulatory blur involving multiple
    compensatory molecular and physiological feedback interactions.

  abstract: >-
    Two general patterns that have emerged from the intense studies on
    insect-host plant associations are a predominance of specialists over
    generalists and a taxonomic conservatism in host plant use. In most
    insect-host plant systems, explanations for these patterns must be based on
    biases in the processes of host colonizations, host shifts, and
    specialization, rather than cospeciation. In the present paper, we
    investigate changes in host range in the nymphalid butterfly tribe
    Nymphalini, using parsimony optimizations of host-plant data on the
    butterfly phylogeny. In addition, we performed larval establishment tests to
    search for larval capacity to feed and survive on plants that have been lost
    from the female egg-laying repertoire. Optimizations suggested an ancestral
    association with Urticaceae, and most of the tested species showed a
    capacity to feed on Urtica dioica regardless of actual host-plant use. In
    addition, there was a bias among the successful establishments on nonhosts
    toward plants that are used as hosts by other species in the Nymphalini. An
    increased likelihood of colonizing ancestral or related plants could also
    provide an alternative explanation for the observed pattern that some plant
    families appear to have been colonized independently several times in the
    tribe. We also show that there is no directionality in host range evolution
    toward increased specialization, that is, specialization is not a dead end.
    Instead, changes in host range show a very dynamic pattern.

    Transcription factors of the plant-specific homeodomain leucine zipper IV
    (HD-ZIP IV) family have been found from moss to higher plants, and several
    family members have been associated with epidermis-related expression and/or
    function. In maize (Zea mays), four of the five characterized HD-ZIP IV
    family members are expressed specifically in the epidermis, one contributes
    to trichome development, and target genes of another one are involved in
    cuticle biosynthesis. Assessing the phylogeny, synteny, gene structure,
    expression, and regulation of the entire family in maize, 12 novel ZmHDZIV
    genes were identified in the recently sequenced maize genome. Among the 17
    genes, eight form homeologous pairs duplicated after the split of maize and
    sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), whereas a fifth duplication is shared with
    sorghum. All 17 ZmHDZIV genes appear to be derived from a basic module
    containing seven introns in the coding region. With one possible exception,
    all 17 ZmHDZIV genes are expressed and show preferential expression in
    immature reproductive organs. Fourteen of 15 ZmHDZIV genes with detectable
    expression in laser-dissected tissues exhibit a moderate to very strong
    expression preference for the epidermis, suggesting that at least in maize,
    the majority of HD-ZIP IV family members may have epidermis-related
    functions. Thirteen ZmHDZIV genes carry conserved motifs of 19 and 21
    nucleotides in their 3' untranslated region. The strong evolutionary
    conservation and the size of the conserved motifs in the 3' untranslated
    region suggest that the expression of HD-ZIP IV genes may be regulated by
    small RNAs.

    We established a collection of 7,000 transgenic lines of Drosophila
    melanogaster. Expression of GAL4 in each line is controlled by a different,
    defined fragment of genomic DNA that serves as a transcriptional enhancer.
    We used confocal microscopy of dissected nervous systems to determine the
    expression patterns driven by each fragment in the adult brain and ventral
    nerve cord. We present image data on 6,650 lines. Using both manual and
    machine-assisted annotation, we describe the expression patterns in the most
    useful lines. We illustrate the utility of these data for identifying novel
    neuronal cell types, revealing brain asymmetry, and describing the nature
    and extent of neuronal shape stereotypy. The GAL4 lines allow expression of
    exogenous genes in distinct, small subsets of the adult nervous system. The
    set of DNA fragments, each driving a documented expression pattern, will
    facilitate the generation of additional constructs for manipulating neuronal
    function.

  abstract: >-
    This paper describes the utilisation of methoxy-resorufin ether as an
    electrochemical probe for studying cytochrome P450 CYP6G1. Methoxy-resorufin
    ether is well established as a versatile substrate for cytochrome P450, as
    its demethylated product, resorufin, is a fluorophore. We show that in
    addition to these established properties, methoxy-resorufin ether also
    exhibits reversible two electron transfer on glassy carbon and edge plane
    graphite electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and differential pulse
    voltammetry measurements show that methoxy-resorufin ether can be easily
    detected at low concentrations (down to 200 nM) in a conventional three
    electrode electrochemical cell. These properties of methoxy-resorufin ether
    mean that it could be used as an electrochemical probe, to follow the rate
    of its demethylation by CYP6G1. We show that electrochemical measurements
    could discriminate between the enzyme activity of protein microsomes taken
    from two strains of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). Crown Copyright (c)

    UV-B radiation is a key environmental signal that initiates diverse
    responses in plants that affect metabolism, development, and viability. Many
    effects of UV-B involve the differential regulation of gene expression. The
    response to UV-B depends on the nature of the UV-B treatment, the extent of
    adaptation and acclimation to UV-B, and interaction with other environmental
    factors. Responses to UV-B are mediated by both nonspecific signaling
    pathways, involving DNA damage, reactive oxygen species, and wound/defense
    signaling molecules, and UV-B-specific pathways that mediate
    photomorphogenic responses to low levels of UV-B. Importantly,
    photomorphogenic signaling stimulates the expression of genes involved in
    UV-protection and hence promotes plant survival in UV-B. Photomorphogenic
    UV-B signaling is mediated by the UV-B-specific component UV RESISTANCE
    LOCUS8 (UVR8). Both UVR8 and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS1 (COP1) are
    required for UV-B-induced expression of the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5)
    transcription factor, which plays a central role in the regulation of genes
    involved in photomorphogenic UV-B responses.

    For more than 420 million years, plants, insects and their predators have
    co-evolved based on a chemical arms race including deployment of refined
    chemical defence systems by each player. Cyanogenic glucosides are produced
    by numerous plants and by some specialized insects and serve an important
    role as defence compounds in these intimate interactions. Burnet moth larvae
    are able to sequester cyanogenic glucosides from their food plant as well as
    to carry out de novo biosynthesis. Here we show that three genes (CYP405A2,
    CYP332A3 and UGT33A1) encode the entire biosynthetic pathway of cyanogenic
    glucosides in the Burnet moth Zygaena filipendulae. In both plants and
    insects, convergent evolution has led to two multifunctional P450 enzymes
    each catalysing unusual reactions and a glucosyl-transferase acting in
    sequence to catalyse cyanogenic glucoside formation. Thus, plants and
    insects have independently found a way to package a cyanide time bomb to
    fend off herbivores and predators.

    Small RNAs have a variety of important roles in plant development, stress
    responses, and other processes. They exert their influence by guiding mRNA
    cleavage, translational repression, and chromatin modification. To identify
    previously unknown rice (Oryza sativa) microRNAs (miRNAs) and those
    regulated by environmental stress, 62 small RNA libraries were constructed
    from rice plants and used for deep sequencing with Illumina technology. The
    libraries represent several tissues from control plants and plants subjected
    to different environmental stress treatments. More than 94 million
    genome-matched reads were obtained, resulting in more than 16 million
    distinct small RNA sequences. This allowed an evaluation of
    \textasciitilde400 annotated miRNAs with current criteria and the finding
    that among these, \textasciitilde150 had small interfering RNA-like
    characteristics. Seventy-six new miRNAs were found, and miRNAs regulated in
    response to water stress, nutrient stress, or temperature stress were
    identified. Among the new examples of miRNA regulation were members of the
    same miRNA family that were differentially regulated in different organs and
    had distinct sequences Some of these distinct family members result in
    differential target cleavage and provide new insight about how an
    agriculturally important rice phenotype could be regulated in the panicle.
    This high-resolution analysis of rice miRNAs should be relevant to plant
    miRNAs in general, particularly in the Poaceae.

    Hox genes have been implicated in the evolution of many animal body
    patterns, but the molecular events underlying trait modification have not
    been elucidated. Pigmentation of the posterior male abdomen is a recently
    acquired trait in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage. Here, we show that
    the Abdominal-B (ABD-B) Hox protein directly activates expression of the
    yellow pigmentation gene in posterior segments. ABD-B regulation of
    pigmentation evolved through the gain of ABD-B binding sites in a specific
    cis-regulatory element of the yellow gene of a common ancestor of sexually
    dimorphic species. Within the melanogaster species group, male-specific
    pigmentation has subsequently been lost by at least three different
    mechanisms, including the mutational inactivation of a key ABD-B binding
    site in one lineage. These results demonstrate how Hox regulation of traits
    and target genes is gained and lost at the species level and have general
    implications for the evolution of body form at higher taxonomic levels.

    Rice contains several MADS box genes. It has been demonstrated previously
    that one of these genes, OsMADS1 (for Oryza sativa MADS box gene1), is
    expressed preferentially in flowers and causes early flowering when
    ectopically expressed in tobacco plants. In this study, we demonstrated that
    ectopic expression of OsMADS1 in rice also results in early flowering. To
    further investigate the role of OsMADS1 during rice flower development, we
    generated transgenic rice plants expressing altered OsMADS1 genes that
    contain missense mutations in the MADS domain. There was no visible
    alteration in the transgenic plants during the vegetative stage. However,
    transgenic panicles typically exhibited phenotypic alterations, including
    spikelets consisting of elongated leafy paleae and lemmas that exhibit a
    feature of open hull, two pairs of leafy palea-like and lemma-like
    lodicules, a decrease in stamen number, and an increase in the number of
    carpels. In addition, some spikelets generated an additional floret from the
    same rachilla. These characteristics are very similar to those of leafy hull
    sterile1 (lhs1). The map position of OsMADS1 is closely linked to that of
    lhs1 on chromosome 3. Examination of lhs1 revealed that it contains two
    missense mutations in the OsMADS1 MADS domain. A genetic complementation
    experiment showed that the 11.9-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the
    wild-type OsMADS1 gene rescued the mutant phenotypes. In addition, ectopic
    expression of the OsMADS1 gene isolated from the lhs1 line resulted in
    lhs1-conferred phenotypes. These lines of evidence demonstrate that OsMADS1
    is the lhs1 gene.

    Motivation 16S rDNA hypervariable tag sequencing has become the de facto
    method for accessing microbial diversity. Illumina paired-end sequencing,
    which produces two separate reads for each DNA fragment, has become the
    platform of choice for this application. However, when the two reads do not
    overlap, existing computational pipelines analyze data from read separately
    and underutilize the information contained in the paired-end reads.  Results
    We created a workflow known as Illinois Mayo Taxon Organization from RNA
    Dataset Operations (IM-TORNADO) for processing non-overlapping reads while
    retaining maximal information content. Using synthetic mock datasets, we
    show that the use of both reads produced answers with greater correlation to
    those from full length 16S rDNA when looking at taxonomy, phylogeny, and
    beta-diversity.  Availability and Implementation IM-TORNADO is freely
    available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/imtornado and produces BIOM
    format output for cross compatibility with other pipelines such as QIIME,
    mothur, and phyloseq.

    The destruction of crops by invertebrate pests is a major threat against a
    background of a continuously rising demand in food supply for a growing
    world population. Therefore, efficient crop protection measures in a vast
    range of agricultural settings are of utmost importance to guarantee
    sustainable yields. The discovery of synthetic agonists selectively
    addressing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), located in the
    central nervous system of insects, for use as insecticides was a major
    milestone in applied crop protection research. These compounds, as a result
    of their high target specificity and versatility in application methods,
    opened a new innovative era in the control of some of the world's most
    devastating insect pests. These insecticides also contributed massively to
    extending our knowledge of the biochemistry of insect nicotinic
    acetylcholine receptors. The global economic success of synthetic nAChR
    agonists as insecticides renders the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor still
    one of the most attractive target sites for exploration in insecticide
    discovery.

    Panicle type has a direct bearing on rice yield. Here, we characterized a
    rice clustered-spikelet mutant, sped1-D, with shortened pedicels and/or
    secondary branches, which exhibits decreased pollen fertility. We cloned
    sped1-D and found that it encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein. We
    investigated the global expression profiles of wild-type, 9311, and sped1-D
    plants using Illumina RNA sequencing. The expression of several GID1L2
    family members was downregulated in the sped1-D mutant, suggesting that the
    gibberellin (GA) pathway is involved in the elongation of pedicels and/or
    secondary branches. When we overexpressed one GID1L2, AK070299, in sped1-D
    plants, the panicle phenotype was restored to varying degrees. In addition,
    we analyzed the expression of genes that function in floral meristems and
    found that RFL and WOX3 were severely downregulated in sped1-D. These
    results suggest that sped1-D may prompt the shortening of pedicels and
    secondary branches by blocking the action of GID1L2, RFL, and Wox3.
    Moreover, overexpression of sped1-D in Arabidopsis resulted in the
    shortening of pedicels and clusters of siliques, which indicates that the
    function of sped1-D is highly conserved in monocotyledonous and
    dicotyledonous plants. Sequence data from this article have been deposited
    with the miRBase Data Libraries under accession no. MI0003201.

    Increasing crop yield is a major challenge for modern agriculture. The
    development of new plant types, which is known as ideal plant architecture
    (IPA), has been proposed as a means to enhance rice yield potential over
    that of existing high-yield varieties. Here, we report the cloning and
    characterization of a semidominant quantitative trait locus, IPA1 (Ideal
    Plant Architecture 1), which profoundly changes rice plant architecture and
    substantially enhances rice grain yield. The IPA1 quantitative trait locus
    encodes OsSPL14 (SOUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 14) and is regulated
    by microRNA (miRNA) OsmiR156 in vivo. We demonstrate that a point mutation
    in OsSPL14 perturbs OsmiR156-directed regulation of OsSPL14, generating an
    'ideal' rice plant with a reduced tiller number, increased lodging
    resistance and enhanced grain yield. Our study suggests that OsSPL14 may
    help improve rice grain yield by facilitating the breeding of new elite rice
    varieties.

  abstract: >-
    Epichloae endophytes of family Clavicipitaceae (comprising genera Epichloë
    and Neotyphodium) are fungal symbionts of Pooideae grasses. The associations
    formed, range from mutually beneficial to antagonistic and the nature of
    this relationship is dependent upon the importance of vertical (via host
    seeds) versus horizontal (ascospore mediated) transmission of the fungus.
    These endophytes can enhance their hosts’ survival through protection from
    abiotic and biotic stresses and can thus be utilized in an agricultural
    context. Animal-safe grass-endophyte associations that confer bio-protective
    properties for increased pasture persistence and productivity have been
    developed and commercialized. One of the crucial drivers underpinning the
    selection of epichloae strains for commercial development is endophyte
    derived bioactivity. The potential of next generation endophytes is
    determined by testing a number of attributes such as agronomic fitness,
    animal and food safety as well as compatibility with host plants of
    interest. Strategic research supports these activities by focusing on
    elucidating mechanisms of compatibility between host and fungal symbiont, as
    well as investigating other molecular drivers of symbiosis such as
    siderophore mediated iron-uptake, fungal signalling, fungal growth in host
    plants and fungal secondary metabolism. This review weaves together the
    different strands of multidisciplinary research aimed at ultimately
    exploiting epichloae endophytes for increased pasture performance.

  abstract: >-
    The rapid and orderly folding of epithelial tissue during developmental
    processes such as gastrulation requires the precise coordination of changes
    in cell shape. Here, we report that the perforin-like protein Torso-like
    (Tsl), the key extracellular determinant for Drosophila embryonic terminal
    patterning, also functions to control epithelial morphogenesis. We find that
    tsl null mutants display a ventral cuticular hole phenotype that is
    independent of the loss of terminal structures, and arises as a consequence
    of mesoderm invagination defects. We show that the holes are caused by
    uncoordinated constriction of ventral cell apices, resulting in the
    formation of an incomplete ventral furrow. Consistent with these data, we
    find that loss of tsl is sensitive to gene dosage of RhoGEF2, a critical
    mediator of Rho1-dependent ventral cell shape changes during furrow
    formation, suggesting that Tsl may act in this pathway. In addition, loss of
    tsl strongly suppressed the effects of ectopic expression of Folded
    Gastrulation (Fog), a secreted protein that promotes apical constriction.
    Taken together, our data suggest that Tsl controls Rho1-mediated apical
    constriction via Fog. Therefore, we propose that Tsl regulates extracellular
    Fog activity to synchronize cell shape changes and coordinate ventral
    morphogenesis in Drosophila. Identifying the Tsl-mediated event that is
    common to both terminal patterning and morphogenesis will be valuable for
    our understanding of the extracellular control of developmental signaling by
    perforin-like proteins.

    Multidrug resistance mediated by the drug-efflux protein P-glycoprotein
    (P-gp) is one mechanism that tumor cells use to escape death induced by
    chemotherapeutic drugs. Although it is irrefutable that P-gp can efflux
    xenobiotics out of cells, biological regulatory functions for P-gp in
    multicellular organisms have yet to be established firmly. Recent
    observations have challenged the notion that P-gp has evolved merely to
    efflux xenotoxins out of healthy cells and raised the possibility that P-gp
    and related transporter molecules might play a fundamental role in
    regulating cell differentiation, proliferation and survival.

    The dramatic progress in sequencing technologies offers unprecedented
    prospects for deciphering the organization of natural populations in space
    and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some
    daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on
    pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS
    software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data.
    Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate
    analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to
    extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently
    available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to
    study the genetic structure of natural populations.

    BACKGROUND: Overexpression of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1 confers
    resistance against DDT and a broad range of other insecticides in Drosophila
    melanogaster Meig. In the absence of crystal structures of CYP6G1 or
    complexes with its substrates, structural studies rely on homology modelling
    and ligand docking to understand P450-substrate interactions.RESULTS:
    Homology models are presented for CYP6G1, a P450 associated with resistance
    to DDT and neonicotinoids, and two other enzymes associated with insecticide
    resistance in D. melanogaster, CYP12D1 and CYP6A2. The models are based on a
    template of the X-ray structure of the phylogenetically related human
    CYP3A4, which is known for its broad substrate specificity. The model of
    CYP6G1 has a much smaller active site cavity than the template. The cavity
    is also 'V'-shaped and is lined with hydrophobic residues, showing high
    shape and chemical complementarity with the molecular characteristics of
    DDT. Comparison of the DDT-CYP6G1 complex and a non-resistant CYP6A2
    homology model implies that tight-fit recognition of this insecticide is
    important in CYP6G1. The active site can accommodate differently shaped
    substrates ranging from imidacloprid to malathion but not the pyrethroids
    permethrin and cyfluthrin.CONCLUSION: The CYP6G1, CYP12D1 and CYP6A2
    homology models can provide a structural insight into insecticide resistance
    in flies overexpressing P450 enzymes with broad substrate specificities. (C)

    Okay, so apparently I lied about bug fixes before py3 release. Here are some
    quick ones. Also -- some users have said that conda recipe fails to find a
    solution, with the help of @reslp this is perhaps caused by ete3 package as
    a dependency. Since ete3 is only used in funannotate for the dN/dS
    calculation in funannotate compare, I'm going to remove it from conda recipe
    as a dependency. Users that would like to continue using the dN/dS function
    in compare will need to manually install ete3 (ie conda could work on your
    system or pip, etc). update the log file copy/remove in funannotate annotate
    which causes a problem in singularity container encoding bug fixes for some
    PFAM results fix for funannotate iprscan which was not correctly combining
    XML files with newer versions of Interproscan.

    Genomic and proteomic analyses of the antennae of the light brown apple
    moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) were
    undertaken to identify genes and proteins potentially involved in odorant
    and pheromone binding and turnover. An EST approach yielded 5739 sequences,
    comprising 808 contigs and 1545 singletons. InterPro and BLAST analyses
    revealed members of families implicated in odorant and pheromone binding
    (PBPs, GOBPs, ABPXs and CSPs) and turnover (CXEs, GSTs, CYPs). Of the three
    pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) identified, two were more highly expressed
    at the RNA and protein levels in adult male antennae (EpPBP1, EpPBP3), while
    a third was more highly expressed in female antennae (EpPBP2). To identify
    proteins involved in the detection of sex-specific signals, differential 2D
    gel electrophoresis (pH 5-8) followed by mass spectrometry was conducted on
    antennal proteins from males versus females. Identified male-biased proteins
    included a pheromone binding protein, a porin, a short chain
    dehydrogenase/reductase, and a member of the takeout family.

    BACKGROUND: With the worldwide use of insecticides, an increasing number of
    pest insect species have evolved target-site or metabolism-based resistance
    towards some of these compounds. The resulting decreased efficacy of
    pesticides threatens human welfare by its impact on crop safety and further
    disease transmission. Environmental concentrations of some insecticides are
    so high that even natural populations of non-target, non-pest organisms such
    as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster Meig. have been selected for
    resistance. Cyp6g1-overexpressing strains of D. melanogaster are resistant
    to a wide range of chemically diverse insecticides, including DDT and
    imidacloprid. However, up to now there has been no evidence that the CYP6G1
    enzyme metabolises any of these compounds. RESULTS: Here it is shown, by
    heterologous expression in cell suspension cultures of Nicotiana tabacum L.
    (tobacco), that CYP6G1 is capable of converting DDT (20 µg per cell culture
    assay) by dechlorination to DDD (18% of applied amount in 48 h), and
    imidacloprid (400 µg) mainly by hydroxylation to 4-hydroxyimidacloprid and
    5-hydroxyimidacloprid (58 and 19% respectively in 48 h). CONCLUSION: Thus,
    the gap between the supposed resistance gene Cyp6g1 and the observed
    resistance phenomenon was closed by the evidence that CYP6G1 is capable of
    metabolising at least two insecticides. Copyright © 2007 Society of Chemical

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP6G1 of Drosophila melanogaster was
    heterologously expressed in a cell suspension culture of Nicotiana tabacum.
    This in vitro system was used to study the capability of CYP6G1 to
    metabolize the insecticide methoxychlor
    (=1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane, 1) against the background
    of endogenous enzymes of the corresponding non-transgenic culture. The
    Cyp6g1-transgenic cell culture metabolized 96% of applied methoxychlor (45.8
    microg per assay) within 24 h by demethylation and hydroxylation mainly to
    trishydroxy and catechol methoxychlor (16 and 17%, resp.). About 34% of the
    metabolism and the distinct formation of trishydroxy and catechol
    methoxychlor were due to foreign enzyme CYP6G1. Furthermore, methoxychlor
    metabolism was inhibited by 43% after simultaneous addition of piperonyl
    butoxide (458 microg), whereas inhibition in the non-transgenic culture
    amounted to 92%. Additionally, the rate of glycosylation was reduced in both
    cultures. These results were supported by the inhibition of the metabolism
    of the insecticide imidacloprid (6; 20 microg, 24 h) in the
    Cyp6g1-transgenic culture by 82% in the presence of piperonyl butoxide (200
    microg). Due to CYP6G1 being responsible for imidacloprid resistance of
    Drosophila or being involved in DDT resistance, it is likely that CYP6G1
    conveys resistance to methoxychlor (1). Furthermore, treating Drosophila
    with piperonyl butoxide could weaken the observed resistance phenomena.

    Epidemiological studies report a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and
    metabolic syndrome in the island nation of Mauritius. The Mauritius Family
    Study was initiated to examine heritable factors that contribute to these
    high rates of prevalence and consists of 400 individuals in 24 large
    extended multigenerational pedigrees. Anthropometric and biochemical
    measurements relating to the metabolic syndrome were undertaken in addition
    to family and lifestyle based information for each individual. Variance
    components methods were used to determine the heritability of the type 2
    diabetes and metabolic syndrome related quantitative traits. The cohort was
    made up of 218 females (55%) and 182 males with 22% diagnosed with type 2
    diabetes and a further 30% having impaired glucose tolerance or impaired
    fasting glucose. Notably BMI was not significantly increased in those with
    type 2 diabetes (P = .12), however a significant increase in waist
    circumference was observed in these groups (P = 02). The heritable
    proportion of trait variance was substantial and greater than values
    previously published for hip circumference, LDL and total cholesterol,
    diastolic and systolic blood pressure and serum creatinine. Height, weight
    and BMI heritabilities were all in the upper range of those previously
    reported. The phenotypic characteristics of the Mauritius family cohort are
    similar to those previously reported in the Mauritian population with a high
    observed prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes. A high heritability for key
    type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome related phenotypes (range 0.23 to
    0.68), suggest the cohort will have utility in identifying genes that
    influence these quantitative traits.

    Mammalian cytochrome P450s provide our first line of defence against the
    toxic effects of environmental chemicals. Ironically these enzymes also
    convert some compounds to their ultimate toxic or mutagenic species. Our
    knowledge of these mammalian enzymes and the role they play in chemical
    toxicity and mutagenesis has stemmed mostly from in vitro studies. In order
    to establish the role of specific enzymes in the toxicological response in
    vivo we have generated transgenic Drosophila which express mammalian
    cytochrome CYP2B1, which is a member of a large gene family encoding several
    important drug metabolising enzymes. The gene was fused to a Drosophila
    promoter which confers expression in the larval fat body. Using the Somatic
    Mutation And Recombination Test (SMART) we have demonstrated that transgenic
    larvae expressing the P450 are hypersensitive to the anticancer drug
    cyclophosphamide, a procarcinogenic substrate which is activated by the
    enzyme. This work demonstrates the potential of such transgenic Drosophila
    strains as an in vivo model for studying the role of specific mammalian drug
    metabolising enzymes in the pathways and metabolic cascades associated with
    the action of cytotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals, and also the chemical
    properties of specific classes of mutagen to be determined.

    Innate immunity is a universal and ancient defense system in metazoans
    against microorganisms. Antimicrobial peptides, which are synthesized both
    in insects and humans, constitute an endogenous, gene-encoded defense
    arsenal. In Drosophila, antimicrobial peptides, such as the potent
    cecropins, are expressed both constitutively in barrier epithelia, as well
    as systemically in response to infection. Rel/NF-kappaB proteins are
    well-known regulators of antimicrobial peptide genes, but very few
    Rel/NF-kappaB co-factors and/or tissue-specific regulators have been
    identified. We performed a double interaction screen in yeast to isolate
    Drosophila cDNAs coding for direct regulators, as well as Dif co-regulators,
    of the CecropinA1 gene. Three classes of positive cDNA clones corresponding
    to 15 Drosophila genes were isolated and further characterized. One of the
    Dif-independent cDNAs encoded the Rel/NF-kappaB protein Relish; a well-known
    activator of antimicrobial peptide genes in Drosophila, demonstrating the
    applicability of this type of screen for isolating regulators of immune
    defense. Most interestingly, three transcription factors belonging to the
    POU domain class of homeodomain proteins, Pdm1, Pdm2 and Dfr/Vvl were
    isolated as Dif-interacting partners, and subsequently verified as
    regulators of CecA1 expression in Drosophila cells. The importance of POU
    proteins in development and differentiation in Drosophila and mammals is
    well documented, but their role in regulation of Drosophila immune defense
    genes is a new and essential finding.

    In spatial statistics the ability to visualize data and models superimposed
    with their basic social landmarks and geographic context is invaluable.
    ggmap is a new tool which enables such visualization by combining the
    spatial information of static maps from Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Stamen
    Maps or CloudMade Maps with the layered grammar of graphics implementation
    of ggplot2. In addition, several new utility functions are introduced which
    allow the user to access the Google Geocoding, Distance Matrix, and
    Directions APIs. The result is an easy, consistent and modular framework for
    spatial graphics with several convenient tools for spatial data analysis.

    Arabidopsis thaliana UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a UV-B-specific
    signaling component that binds to chromatin and regulates UV protection by
    orchestrating expression of a range of genes. Here, we studied how UV-B
    regulates UVR8. We show that UV-B stimulates the nuclear accumulation of
    both a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-UVR8 fusion and native UVR8. Nuclear
    accumulation leads to UV-B induction of the HY5 gene, encoding a key
    transcriptional effector of the UVR8 pathway. Nuclear accumulation of UVR8
    is specific to UV-B, occurs at low fluence rates, and is observed within 5
    min of UV-B exposure. Attachment of a nuclear export signal (NES) to
    GFP-UVR8 causes cytosolic localization in the absence of UV-B. However, UV-B
    promotes rapid nuclear accumulation of NES-GFP-UVR8, indicating a concerted
    mechanism for nuclear translocation. UVR8 lacking the N-terminal 23 amino
    acids is impaired in nuclear translocation. Attachment of a nuclear
    localization signal (NLS) to UVR8 causes constitutive nuclear localization.
    However, NLS-GFP-UVR8 only confers HY5 gene expression following UV-B
    illumination, indicating that nuclear localization, although necessary for
    UVR8 function, is insufficient to cause expression of target genes; UV-B is
    additionally required to stimulate UVR8 function in the nucleus. These
    findings provide new insights into the mechanisms through which UV-B
    regulates gene expression in plants.

    cis-regulatory DNA sequences known as enhancers control gene expression in
    space and time. They are central to metazoan development and are often
    responsible for changes in gene regulation that contribute to phenotypic
    evolution. Here, we examine the sequence, function, and genomic location of
    enhancers controlling tissue-and cell-type specific expression of the yellow
    gene in six Drosophila species. yellow is required for the production of
    dark pigment, and its expression has evolved largely in concert with
    divergent pigment patterns. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a transgenic
    host, we examined the expression of reporter genes in which either 5'
    intergenic or intronic sequences of yellow from each species controlled the
    expression of Green Fluorescent Protein. Surprisingly, we found that
    sequences controlling expression in the wing veins, as well as sequences
    controlling expression in epidermal cells of the abdomen, thorax, and wing,
    were located in different genomic regions in different species. By contrast,
    sequences controlling expression in bristle-associated cells were located in
    the intron of all species. Differences in the precise pattern of spatial
    expression within the developing epidermis of D. melanogaster transformants
    usually correlated with adult pigmentation in the species from which the
    cis-regulatory sequences were derived, which is consistent with
    cis-regulatory evolution affecting yellow expression playing a central role
    in Drosophila pigmentation divergence. Sequence comparisons among species
    favored a model in which sequential nucleotide substitutions were
    responsible for the observed changes in cis-regulatory architecture. Taken
    together, these data demonstrate frequent changes in yellow cis-regulatory
    architecture among Drosophila species. Similar analyses of other genes,
    combining in vivo functional tests of enhancer activity with in silico
    comparative genomics, are needed to determine whether the pattern of
    regulatory evolution we observed for yellow is characteristic of genes with
    rapidly evolving expression patterns.

    Perception of temperature is an important brain function for organisms to
    survive. Evidence suggests that temperature preference behavior (TPB) in
    Drosophila melanogaster, one of poikilothermal animals, is regulated by
    cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling in mushroom bodies of the
    brain. However, downstream targets for the PKA signaling in this behavior
    have not been identified. From a genome-wide search for the genes regulated
    by PKA activity in the mushroom bodies, we identified the cyp6a17 Cytochrome
    P450 gene as a new target for PKA. Our detailed analysis of mutants by
    genetic, molecular and behavioral assays shows that cyp6a17 is essential for
    temperature preference behavior. cyp6a17 expression is enriched in the
    mushroom bodies of the adult brain. Tissue-specific knockdown and rescue
    experiments demonstrate that cyp6a17 is required in the mushroom bodies for
    normal temperature preference behavior. This is the first study, to our
    knowledge, to show PKA-dependent expression of a cytochrome P450 gene in the
    mushroom bodies and its role as a key factor for temperature preference
    behavior. Taken together, this study reveals a new PKA-Cytochrome P450
    pathway that regulates the temperature preference behavior.

    By the onset of morphogenesis, Drosophila embryos consist of about 6000
    cells that express distinct gene combinations. Here, we used single-cell
    sequencing of precisely staged embryos and devised DistMap, a computational
    mapping strategy to reconstruct the embryo and to predict spatial gene
    expression approaching single-cell resolution. We produce a virtual embryo
    with about 8000 expressed genes per cell. Our interactive
    “Drosophila-Virtual-Expression-eXplorer” (DVEX) database generates
    three-dimensional virtual in situ hybridizations and computes gene
    expression gradients. We used DVEX to uncover patterned expression of
    transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs, as well as signaling pathway
    components. Spatial regulation of Hippo signaling during early embryogenesis
    suggests a mechanism for establishing asynchronous cell proliferation. Our
    approach is suitable to generate transcriptomic blueprints for other complex
    tissues.

  abstract: >-
    The two most damaging biotypes of Bemisia tabaci, B and Q, have both evolved
    strong resistance to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid. The major
    mechanism in all samples investigated so far appeared to be enhanced
    detoxification by cytochrome P450s monooxygenases (P450s). In this study, a
    polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology using degenerate primers based on
    conserved P450 helix I and heme-binding regions was employed to identify
    P450 cDNA sequences in B. tabaci that might be involved in imidacloprid
    resistance. Eleven distinct P450 cDNA sequences were isolated and classified
    as members of the CYP4 or CYP6 families. The mRNA expression levels of all
    11 genes were compared by real-time quantitative RT-PCR across nine B and Q
    field-derived strains of B. tabaci showing strong resistance, moderate
    resistance or susceptibility to imidacloprid. We found that constitutive
    over-expression (up to ∼17-fold) of a single P450 gene, CYP6CM1, was tightly
    related to imidacloprid resistance in both the B and Q biotypes. Next, we
    identified three single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers in the intron
    region of CYP6CM1 that discriminate between the resistant and susceptible
    Q-biotype CYP6CM1 alleles (r-Q and s-Q, respectively), and used a
    heterogeneous strain to test for association between r-Q and resistance.
    While survivors of a low imidacloprid dose carried both the r-Q and s-Q
    alleles, ∼95% of the survivors of a high imidacloprid dose carried only the
    r-Q allele. Together with previous evidence, the results reported here
    identify enhanced activity of P450s as the major mechanism of imidacloprid
    resistance in B. tabaci, and the CYP6CM1 gene as a leading target for
    DNA-based screening for resistance to imidacloprid and possibly other
    neonicotinoids in field populations.

    The neonicotinoid imidacloprid is one of the most important insecticides
    worldwide. It is used extensively against the whitefly Bemisia tabaci
    (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), an insect pest of eminent importance globally,
    which was also the first pest to develop high levels of resistance against
    imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids in the field. Recent reports indicated
    that in both the B and Q biotypes of B. tabaci, the resistant phenotype is
    associated with over-expression of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP6CM1. In this
    study, molecular docking and dynamic simulations were used to analyze
    interactions of imidacloprid with the biotype Q variant of the CYP6CM1
    enzyme (CYP6CM1vQ). The binding mode with the lowest energy in the enzyme
    active site, the key amino acids involved (i.e. Phe-130 and Phe-226), and
    the putative hydroxylation site (lowest distance to carbon 5 of the
    imidazolidine ring system of imidacloprid) were predicted. Heterologous
    expression of the CYP6CM1vQ confirmed the accuracy of our predictions and
    demonstrated that the enzyme catalyses the hydroxylation of imidacloprid to
    its less toxic 5-hydroxy form (K-cat = 3.2 pmol/min/pmol P450, K-m = 36 mu
    M). The data identify CYP6CM1vQ as a principle target for inhibitor design,
    aimed at inactivating insecticide-metabolizing P450s in natural insect pest
    populations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    To analyze cytochrome P450s in the southern house mosquito, Culex
    quinquefasciatus, we quantified the content of P450s and b(5) in larval
    microsomes of guts and carcasses. Results indicated that content was 30
    times higher in guts than in carcasses. A conserved region in the alignment
    of insect P450 family 6 (CYP6) proteins served as a guide for the synthesis
    of degenerate oligonucleotide primers to clone P450 cDNAs. Primers were used
    in the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of gut mRNA
    from 4th-instar larvae of the permethrin-susceptible or resistant C.
    quinquefasciatus. PCR products of ca. 250 base pairs (bp) were cloned, and
    nucleotide sequences of 35 clones from susceptible and 28 from resistant
    strains determined. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences from these
    clones showed them to be classifiable into six isoforms. We next screened a
    cDNA clone (CYP6F1) from a gut cDNA library and determined the nucleotide
    sequence. Northern blot analysis showed that the CYP6F1 gene in the
    permethrin-resistant strain appeared to be expressed more strongly than in
    the susceptible strain. The deduced amino acid of CYP6F1 showed that it has
    conserved domains of a membrane-anchoring signal, reductase binding sites, a
    heme-binding site, ETLR motif and substrate recognition sites in P450s.
    Phylogenetic analysis showed that CYP6F1 is strongly related to CYP6D1
    involved in pyrethroid detoxification. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

    The MADS-domain transcription factor APETALA1 (AP1) is a key regulator of
    Arabidopsis flower development. To understand the molecular mechanisms
    underlying AP1 function, we identified its target genes during floral
    initiation using a combination of gene expression profiling and genome-wide
    binding studies. Many of its targets encode transcriptional regulators,
    including known floral repressors. The latter genes are down-regulated by
    AP1, suggesting that it initiates floral development by abrogating the
    inhibitory effects of these genes. Although AP1 acts predominantly as a
    transcriptional repressor during the earliest stages of flower development,
    at more advanced stages it also activates regulatory genes required for
    floral organ formation, indicating a dynamic mode of action. Our results
    further imply that AP1 orchestrates floral initiation by integrating growth,
    patterning, and hormonal pathways.

  abstract: >-
    There is an urgent need to create new solutions for sustainable agricultural
    practices that circumvent the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides and
    increase the resilience of agricultural systems to environmental change.
    Beneficial microbial symbionts of plants are expected to play an important
    role in integrated pest management schemes over the coming decades. Epichloë
    endophytes, symbiotic fungi of many grass species, can protect plants
    against several stressors, and could therefore help to increase the
    productivity of forage grasses and the hardiness of turf grasses while
    reducing the use of synthetic pesticides. Indeed, Epichloë endophytes have
    successfully been developed and commercialized for agricultural use in the
    USA, Australia and New Zealand. Many of the host grass species originate
    from Europe, which is a biodiversity hotspot for both grasses and
    endophytes. However, intentional use of endophyte-enhanced grasses in Europe
    is virtually non-existent. We suggest that the diversity of European
    Epichloë endophytes and their host grasses should be exploited for the
    development of sustainable agricultural, horticultural and landscaping
    practices, and potentially for bioremediation and bioenergy purposes, and
    for environmental improvement.

    Although the number of sequenced insect genomes numbers in the hundreds,
    little is known about gene regulatory sequences in any species other than
    the well-studied Drosophila melanogaster. We provide here a detailed
    protocol for using SCRMshaw, a computational method for predicting
    cis-regulatory modules (CRMs, also “enhancers”) in sequenced insect genomes.
    SCRMshaw is effective for CRM discovery throughout the range of
    holometabolous insects and potentially in even more diverged species, with
    true-positive prediction rates of 75% or better. Minimal requirements for
    using SCRMshaw are a genome sequence and training data in the form of known
    Drosophila CRMs; a comprehensive set of the latter can be obtained from the
    SCRMshaw download site. For basic applications, a user with only modest
    computational know-how can run SCRMshaw on a desktop computer. SCRMshaw can
    be run with a single, narrow set of training data to predict CRMs regulating
    a specific pattern of gene expression, or with multiple sets of training
    data covering a broad range of CRM activities to provide an initial rough
    regulatory annotation of a complete, newly-sequenced genome.

  abstract: >-
    Many genes familiar from Drosophila development, such as the so-called gap,
    pair-rule, and segment polarity genes, play important roles in the
    development of other insects and in many cases appear to be deployed in a
    similar fashion, despite the fact that Drosophila -like “long germband”
    development is highly derived and confined to a subset of insect families.
    Whether or not these similarities extend to the regulatory level is unknown.
    Identification of regulatory regions beyond the well-studied Drosophila has
    been challenging as even within the Diptera (flies, including mosquitoes)
    regulatory sequences have diverged past the point of recognition by standard
    alignment methods. Here, we demonstrate that methods we previously developed
    for computational cis -regulatory module (CRM) discovery in Drosophila can
    be used effectively in highly diverged (250–350 Myr) insect species
    including Anopheles gambiae , Tribolium castaneum , Apis mellifera , and
    Nasonia vitripennis . In Drosophila , we have successfully used small sets
    of known CRMs as “training data” to guide the search for other CRMs with
    related function. We show here that although species-specific CRM training
    data do not exist, training sets from Drosophila can facilitate CRM
    discovery in diverged insects. We validate in vivo over a dozen new CRMs,
    roughly doubling the number of known CRMs in the four non- Drosophila
    species. Given the growing wealth of Drosophila CRM annotation, these
    results suggest that extensive regulatory sequence annotation will be
    possible in newly sequenced insects without recourse to costly and
    labor-intensive genome-scale experiments. We develop a new method, Regulus,
    which computes a probabilistic score of similarity based on binding site
    composition (despite the absence of nucleotide-level sequence alignment),
    and demonstrate similarity between functionally related CRMs from
    orthologous loci. Our work represents an important step toward being able to
    trace the evolutionary history of gene regulatory networks and defining the
    mechanisms underlying insect evolution.

    The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is the most
    serious insect pest of western North American pine forests. A recent
    outbreak destroyed more than 15 million hectares of pine forests, with major
    environmental effects on forest health, and economic effects on the forest
    industry. The outbreak has in part been driven by climate change, and will
    contribute to increased carbon emissions through decaying forests.

    The origin and early evolution of land plants in the mid-Palaeozoic era,
    between about 480 and 360 million years ago, was an important event in the
    history of life, with far-reaching consequences for the evolution of
    terrestrial organisms and global environments. A recent surge of interest,
    catalysed by palaeobotanical discoveries and advances in the systematics of
    living plants, provides a revised perspective on the evolution of early land
    plants and suggests new directions for future research.

    WE have found that mutations in the gene daf-2 can cause fertile, active,
    adult Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites to live more than twice as long
    as wild type. This lifespan extension, the largest yet reported in any
    organism1, requires the activity of a second gene, daf-16. Both genes also
    regulate formation of the dauer larva, a developmentally arrested larval
    form that is induced by crowding and starvation and is very long-lived2-4.
    Our findings raise the possibility that the longevity of the dauer is not
    simply a consequence of its arrested growth, but instead results from a
    regulated lifespan extension mechanism that can be uncoupled from other
    aspects of dauer formation. daf-2 and daf-16 provide entry points into
    understanding how lifespan can be extended.

  abstract: >-
    SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS box transcription factors mediate floral development in
    association with other regulators. Mutants in five rice (Oryza sativa) SEP
    genes suggest both redundant and unique functions in panicle branching and
    floret development. leafy hull sterile1/OsMADS1, from a grass-specific
    subgroup of LOFSEP genes, is required for specifying a single floret on the
    spikelet meristem and for floret organ development, but its downstream
    mechanisms are unknown. Here, key pathways and directly modulated targets of
    OsMADS1 were deduced from expression analysis after its knockdown and
    induction in developing florets and by studying its chromatin occupancy at
    downstream genes. The negative regulation of OsMADS34, another LOFSEP gene,
    and activation of OsMADS55, a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like floret meristem
    identity gene, show its role in facilitating the spikelet-to-floret meristem
    transition. Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4
    (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain
    member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem
    maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development. We found that the
    OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel
    differentiation. The multiple effects of OsMADS1 in promoting auxin
    transport, signaling, and auxin-dependent expression and its direct
    repression of three cytokinin A-type response regulators show its role in
    balancing meristem growth, lateral organ differentiation, and determinacy.
    Overall, we show that OsMADS1 integrates transcriptional and signaling
    pathways to promote rice floret specification and development.

    The ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) gene of a single enveloped
    nucleopolyhedrovirus was located using an Hz-SNPV gene-specific probe. This
    SNPV was found infecting a colony of Helicoverpa armigera (HaSNPV) in the
    Western Cape region of South Africa. The open reading frame of the HaSNPV-SA
    egt is 1.548 nucleotides long and encodes a predicted protein of 516 amino
    acids with a M-r of 58,897-kDa. The 5'-noncoding region contained an early
    transcription initiation motif (CAGT) and a baculovirus late transcription
    motif (ATAAG). A transcription enhancer sequence (GATA) was also identified.
    Two possible TATA boxes together with am AT rich region were also
    recognized. A putative signal peptide of 20 residues was present at the
    N-terminus of the predicted EGT sequence. A polyadenylation signal (AATAAA)
    was found downstream of the translation stop codon. Five Helicoverpa NPV
    EGT's that have an extremely high degree of nucleotide and amino acid
    sequence homology were used in this study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
    (SNPs) within the gene were tabulated. The Helicoverpa NPV egts seem to be
    closely related to the egt genes of Mamestra configurata NPV (MacoNPV),
    Buzura suppressaria NPV (BusuSNPV) and Spodoptera exigua NPV (SeMNPV) with
    amino acid identities of approximately 50%. The Helicoverpa NPV EGTs show
    ten conserved motifs with other EGTs. A phylogenetic tree of 27 baculovirus
    EGTs and a human UDP-glucoronosyltransferase was constructed using
    Neighbour-joining within CLUSTAL X. That a secreted and active EGT is
    encoded by HaSNPV-SA was confirmed by assay of infected cell culture medium.

  abstract: >-
    The recruitment of modular developmental genetic components into new
    developmental contexts has been proposed as a central mechanism enabling the
    origin of novel traits and trait functions without necessitating the origin
    of novel pathways. Here, we investigate the function of the hedgehog (Hh)
    signaling pathway, a highly conserved pathway best understood for its role
    in patterning anterior/posterior (A/P) polarity of diverse traits, in the
    developmental evolution of beetle horns, an evolutionary novelty, and horn
    polyphenisms, a highly derived form of environment-responsive trait
    induction. We show that interactions among pathway members are conserved
    during development of Onthophagus horned beetles and have retained the
    ability to regulate A/P polarity in traditional appendages, such as legs. At
    the same time, the Hh signaling pathway has acquired a novel and highly
    unusual role in the nutrition-dependent regulation of horn polyphenisms by
    actively suppressing horn formation in low-nutrition males. Down-regulation
    of Hh signaling lifts this inhibition and returns a highly derived sigmoid
    horn body size allometry to its presumed ancestral, linear state. Our
    results suggest that recruitment of the Hh signaling pathway may have been a
    key step in the evolution of trait thresholds, such as those involved in
    horn polyphenisms and the corresponding origin of alternative phenotypes and
    complex allometries.

    Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid,
    accurate, and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on
    desktop computers. The system uses an indexing scheme based on the
    Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index,
    optimized specifically for the metagenomic classification problem.
    Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (4.2 GB for 4078 bacterial and
    200 archaeal genomes) and classifies sequences at very high speed, allowing
    it to process the millions of reads from a typical high-throughput DNA
    sequencing run within a few minutes. Together, these advances enable timely
    and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional
    desktop computers. Because of its space-optimized indexing schemes,
    Centrifuge also makes it possible to index the entire NCBI nonredundant
    nucleotide sequence database (a total of 109 billion bases) with an index
    size of 69 GB, in contrast to k-mer-based indexing schemes, which require
    far more extensive space.

    well elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of OsMADS51, a type I
    MADS-box gene in the short-day (SD) promotion pathway in rice (Oryza
    sativa). In SDs OsMADS51 null mutants flowered 2 weeks later than normal,
    whereas in long days loss of OsMADS51 had little effect on flowering.
    Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-Ehd1, OsMADS14, and
    Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were
    unchanged. Ectopic expression of OsMADS51 caused flowering to occur about 7
    d earlier only in SDs. In ectopic expression lines, transcript levels of
    Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a were increased, but those of OsGI and Hd1 remained
    the same. These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter,
    particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1,
    OsMADS14, and Hd3a. To further investigate the relationship with other
    flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of
    Ehd1 or OsGI was suppressed. In Ehd1 RNA interference plants, OsMADS51
    expression was not affected, supporting our conclusion that the MADS-box
    gene functions upstream of Ehd1. However, in OsGI antisense plants, the
    OsMADS51 transcript level was reduced. In addition, the circadian expression
    pattern for this MADS-box gene was similar to that for OsGI. These results
    demonstrate that OsMADS51 functions downstream of OsGI. In summary, OsMADS51
    is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI
    to Ehd1.

    TopHat is a popular spliced aligner for RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) experiments.
    In this paper, we describe TopHat2, which incorporates many significant
    enhancements to TopHat. TopHat2 can align reads of various lengths produced
    by the latest sequencing technologies, while allowing for variable-length
    indels with respect to the reference genome. In addition to de novo spliced
    alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur
    after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the ability to identify novel
    splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive
    and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the
    presence of pseudogenes. TopHat2 is available at
    http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat.

    Exposure to xenobiotics such as plant toxins, pollutants, or prescription
    drugs triggers a defense response, inducing genes that encode key
    detoxification enzymes. Although xenobiotic responses have been studied in
    vertebrates, little effort has been made to exploit a simple genetic system
    for characterizing the molecular basis of this coordinated transcriptional
    response. We show here that similar to 1000 transcripts are significantly
    affected by phenobarbital treatment in Drosophila. We also demonstrate that
    the Drosophila ortholog of the human SXR and CAR xenobiotic receptors,
    DHR96, plays a role in this response. A DHR96 null mutant displays increased
    sensitivity to the sedative effects of phenobarbital and the pesticide DDT
    as well as defects in the expression of many phenobarbital-regulated genes.
    Metabolic and stress-response genes are also controlled by DHR96,
    implicating its role in coordinating multiple response pathways. This work
    establishes a new model system for defining the genetic control of
    xenobiotic stress responses.

    A new paradigm of gene expression regulation has emerged recently with the
    discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs). Most, if not all, miRNAs are thought to
    control gene expression, mostly by base pairing with miRNA-recognition
    elements (MREs) found in their messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Although a
    large number of human miRNAs have been reported, many of their mRNA targets
    remain unknown. Here we used a combined bioinformatics and experimental
    approach to identify important rules governing miRNA-MRE recognition that
    allow prediction of human miRNA targets. We describe a computational
    program, "DIANA-microT", that identifies mRNA targets for animal miRNAs and
    predicts mRNA targets, bearing single MREs, for human and mouse miRNAs.

    Cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins compose a highly diverse superfamily found in
    all domains of life. These proteins are enzymes involved in metabolism of
    endogenous and exogenous compounds. In vertebrates, the CYP2 family is one
    of the largest, most diverse and plays an important role in mammalian drug
    metabolism. However, there are more than 20 vertebrate CYP2 subfamilies with
    uncertain evolution and fairly discrete subfamily composition within
    vertebrate classes, hindering extrapolation of knowledge across subfamilies.
    To better understand CYP2 diversity, a phylogenetic analysis of 196 CYP2
    protein sequences from 16 species was performed using a maximum likelihood
    approach and Bayesian inference. The analyses included the CYP2 compliment
    from human, fugu, zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, cow, and dog genomes.
    Additional sequences were included from rabbit, marsupial, platypus,
    chicken, frog, and salmonid species. Three CYP2 sequences from the tunicate
    Ciona intestinalis were utilized as the outgroup. Results indicate a single
    ancestral vertebrate CYP2 gene and monophyly of all CYP2 subfamilies. Two
    subfamilies (CYP2R and CYP2U) pre-date vertebrate diversification, allowing
    direct comparison across vertebrate classes, while all other subfamilies
    originated during vertebrate diversification, often within specific
    vertebrate lineages. Analysis of site-specific evolution indicates that some
    substrate recognition sites (SRS) previously proposed for CYP genes do not
    have elevated rates of evolution, suggesting that these regions of the
    protein are not necessarily important in recognition of CYP2 substrates.
    Type II functional divergence analysis identified multiple residues in the
    active site of CYP2F, CYP2A, and CYP2B proteins that have undergone radical
    biochemical changes and may be functionally important.

  abstract: >-
    In plants, the transition to reproductive growth is of particular importance
    for successful seed production. Transformation of the shoot apical meristem
    (SAM) to the inflorescence meristem (IM) is the crucial first step in this
    transition. Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that
    expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL
    (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during
    meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa). PAP2 is a MADS box gene
    belonging to a grass-specific subclade of the SEPALLATA subfamily.
    Suppression of these three AP1/FUL-like genes by RNA interference caused a
    slight delay in reproductive transition. Further depletion of PAP2 function
    from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem
    to the IM. In the quadruple knockdown lines, the meristem continued to
    generate leaves, rather than becoming an IM. Consequently, multiple shoots
    were formed instead of an inflorescence. PAP2 physically interacts with
    MAD14 and MADS15 in vivo. Furthermore, the precocious flowering phenotype
    caused by the overexpression of Hd3a, a rice florigen gene, was weakened in
    pap2-1 mutants. Based on these results, we propose that PAP2 and the three
    AP1/FUL-like genes coordinately act in the meristem to specify the identity
    of the IM downstream of the florigen signal.

  abstract: >-
    In rice panicle development, new meristems are generated sequentially in an
    organized manner and acquire their identity in a time- and
    position-dependent manner. In the panicle of the panicle phytomer2-1
    (pap2-1) mutant, the pattern of meristem initiation is disorganized and
    newly formed meristems show reduced competency to become spikelet meristems,
    resulting in the transformation of early arising spikelets into rachis
    branches. In addition, rudimentary glumes and sterile lemmas, the outermost
    organs of the spikelet, elongate into a leafy morphology. We propose that
    PAP2 is a positive regulator of spikelet meristem identity. Map-based
    cloning revealed that PAP2 encodes OsMADS34, a member of the SEPALLATA (SEP)
    subfamily of MADS-box proteins. PAP2/OsMADS34 belongs to the LOFSEP subgroup
    of MADS-box genes that show grass-specific diversification caused by gene
    duplication events. All five SEP subfamily genes in rice are expressed
    exclusively during panicle development, while their spatial and temporal
    expression patterns vary. PAP2 expression starts the earliest among the five
    SEP genes, and a low but significant level of PAP2 mRNA was detected in the
    inflorescence meristem, in branch meristems immediately after the
    transition, and in glume primordia, consistent with its role in the early
    development of spikelet formation. Our study provides new evidence
    supporting the hypothesis that the genes of the LOFSEP subgroup control
    developmental processes that are unique to grass species.

    Short linear motifs (SLiMs) can play pivotal functional roles in proteins,
    such as targeting proteins to specific subcellular localizations, modulating
    the efficiency of translation and tagging proteins for degradation. Until
    recently we had little knowledge about SLiM evolution. Only a few amino
    acids in these motifs are functionally important, making them likely to
    evolve ex nihilo and suggesting that they can play key roles in protein
    evolution. Several reports now suggest that these motifs can appear and
    disappear while their function in the protein is preserved, a process
    sometimes referred to as "turnover". However, there has been a lack of
    specific experiments to determine whether independently evolved motifs do
    indeed have the same function, which would conclusively determine whether
    the process of turnover actually occurs. In this study, we experimentally
    detected evidence for such a mutational turnover process for nuclear
    localization signals (NLS) during the post-duplication divergence of the
    Complementary sex determiner (Csd) and Feminizer (Fem) proteins in the
    honeybee (Apis mellifera) lineage. Experiments on the nuclear transport
    activity of protein segments and those of the most recent common ancestor
    (MRCA) sequences revealed that three new NLS motifs evolved in the Csd
    protein during the post-duplication divergence while other NLS motifs were
    lost that existed before duplication. A screen for essential and newly
    evolved amino acids revealed that new motifs in the Csd protein evolved by
    one or two missense mutations coding for lysine. Amino acids that were
    predating the duplication were also essential in the acquisition of the C1
    motif suggesting that the ex nihilo origin was constrained by preexisting
    amino acids in the physical proximity. Our data support a model in which
    stabilizing selection maintains the constancy of nuclear transport function
    but allowed mutational turnover of the encoding NLS motifs.

    Inflorescences of grass species have a distinct morphology in which florets
    are grouped in compact branches called spikelets. Although many studies have
    shown that the molecular and genetic mechanisms that control floret organ
    formation are conserved between monocots and dicots, little is known about
    the genetic pathway leading to spikelet formation. In the frizzy panicle
    (fzp) mutant of rice, the formation of florets is replaced by sequential
    rounds of branching. Detailed analyses revealed that several rudimentary
    glumes are formed in each ectopic branch, indicating that meristems acquire
    spikelet identity. However, instead of proceeding to floret formation,
    axillary meristems are formed in the axils of rudimentary glumes and they
    either arrest or develop into branches of higher order. The fzp mutant
    phenotype suggests that FZP is required to prevent the formation of axillary
    meristems within the spikelet meristem and permit the subsequent
    establishment of floral meristem identity. The FZP gene was isolated by
    transposon tagging. FZP encodes an ERF transcription factor and is the rice
    ortholog of the maize BD1 gene. Consistent with observations from phenotypic
    analyses, FZP expression was found to be restricted to the time of
    rudimentary glumes differentiation in a half-ring domain at the base of
    which the rudimentary glume primordium emerged.

    The aerial architecture of plants is determined primarily by the pattern of
    shoot branching. Although shoot apical meristem initiation during
    embryogenesis has been extensively studied by molecular genetic approaches
    using Arabidopsis, little is known about the genetic mechanisms controlling
    axillary meristem initiation, mainly because of the insufficient number of
    mutants that specifically alter it. We identified the LAX PANICLE (LAX) and
    SMALL PANICLE (SPA) genes as the main regulators of axillary meristem
    formation in rice. LAX encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
    and is expressed in the boundary between the shoot apical meristem and the
    region of new meristem formation. This pattern of LAX expression was
    repeatedly observed in every axillary meristem, consistent with our
    observation that LAX is involved in the formation of all types of axillary
    meristems throughout the ontogeny of a rice plant. Ectopic LAX expression in
    rice caused pleiotropic effects, including dwarfing, an altered pattern of
    stem elongation, darker color, bending of the lamina joint, absence of the
    midribs of leaves, and severe sterility.

    RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1/FT-L3) is the closest homologue of Heading
    date 3a (Hd3a), which is thought to encode a mobile flowering signal and
    promote floral transition under short-day (SD) conditions. RFT1 is located
    only 11.5 kb from Hd3a on chromosome 6. Although RFT1 RNAi plants flowered
    normally, double RFT1-Hd3a RNAi plants did not flower up to 300 days after
    sowing (DAS), indicating that Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in
    rice. RFT1 expression was very low in wild-type plants, but there was a
    marked increase in RFT1 expression by 70 DAS in Hd3a RNAi plants, which
    flowered 90 DAS. H3K9 acetylation around the transcription initiation site
    of the RFT1 locus had increased by 70 DAS but not at 35 DAS. In the absence
    of Hd3a and RFT1 expression, transcription of OsMADS14 and OsMADS15, two
    rice orthologues of Arabidopsis APETALA1, was strongly reduced, suggesting
    that they act downstream of Hd3a and RFT1. These results indicate that Hd3a
    and RFT1 act as floral activators under SD conditions, and that RFT1
    expression is partly regulated by chromatin modification.

    RNAi is a gene-silencing phenomenon mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
    and has become a powerful tool to elucidate gene function. To accomplish
    rapid construction of transgenes expressing dsRNA in Drosophila, we
    developed a novel transformation vector, pRISE, which contains an inverted
    repeat of the attR1-ccdB-attR2 cassette for in vitro recombination and a
    pentameric GAL4 binding site for conditional expression. These features
    enabled us to construct RNAi transgenes without a complicated cloning
    scheme. In cultured cells and transgenic flies, pRISE constructs carrying
    dsRNA transgenes induced effective RNAi against an EGFP transgene and the
    endogenous white gene, respectively. These results indicate that pRISE is a
    convenient transformation vector for studies of multiple Drosophila genes
    for which functional information is lacking.

    Host plant shifts by phytophagous insects play a key role in insect
    evolution and plant ecology. Such shifts often involve major behavioral
    changes as the insects must acquire an attraction and/or lose the repulsion
    to the new host plant's odor and taste. The evolution of chemotactic
    behavior may be due, in part, to gene expression changes in the peripheral
    sensory system. To test this hypothesis, we compared gene expression in the
    olfactory organs of Drosophila sechellia, a narrow ecological specialist
    that feeds on the fruit of Morinda citrifolia, with its close relatives
    Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster, which feed on a wide
    variety of decaying plant matter. Using whole-genome microarrays and
    quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we surveyed the entire repertoire of
    Drosophila odorant receptors (ORs) and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs)
    expressed in the antennae. We found that the evolution of OR and OBP
    expression was accelerated in D. sechellia compared both with the genome
    average in that species and with the rate of OR and OBP evolution in the
    other species. However, some of the gene expression changes that correlate
    with D. sechellia's increased sensitivity to Morinda odorants may predate
    its divergence from D. simulans. Interspecific divergence of olfactory gene
    expression cannot be fully explained by changes in the relative abundance of
    different sensilla as some ORs and OBPs have evolved independently of other
    genes expressed in the same sensilla. A number of OR and OBP genes are
    upregulated in D. sechellia compared with its generalist relatives. These
    genes include Or22a, which likely responds to a key odorant of M.
    citrifolia, and several genes that are yet to be characterized in detail.
    Increased expression of these genes in D. sechellia may have contributed to
    the evolution of its unique chemotactic behavior.

    Complex allelic variation hampers the assembly of haplotype-resolved
    sequences from diploid genomes. We developed trio binning, an approach that
    simplifies haplotype assembly by resolving allelic variation before
    assembly. In contrast with prior approaches, the effectiveness of our method
    improved with increasing heterozygosity. Trio binning uses short reads from
    two parental genomes to first partition long reads from an offspring into
    haplotype-specific sets. Each haplotype is then assembled independently,
    resulting in a complete diploid reconstruction. We used trio binning to
    recover both haplotypes of a diploid human genome and identified complex
    structural variants missed by alternative approaches. We sequenced an F1
    cross between the cattle subspecies Bos taurus taurus and Bos taurus indicus
    and completely assembled both parental haplotypes with NG50 haplotig sizes
    of >20 Mb and 99.998% accuracy, surpassing the quality of current cattle
    reference genomes. We suggest that trio binning improves diploid genome
    assembly and will facilitate new studies of haplotype variation and
    inheritance.

    CYP6D1 is a housefly cytochrome P450 known to metabolize neurotoxic
    pyrethroid insecticides. To determine if the nervous system was capable of
    metabolizing pyrethroids, we examined CYP6D1-mediated in vitro metabolism in
    thoracic ganglia from pyrethroid-resistant (LPR) and -susceptible (CS)
    strains of housefly. SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting revealed that CYP6D1 was
    expressed in all tagmata and in thoracic ganglia of both strains, but in all
    cases the levels of CYP6D1 were higher in the LPR strain. Using a
    CYP6D1-specific antiserum, we found CYP6D1 to be the major, and possibly the
    only, P450 isozyme involved in cypermethrin metabolism in thoracic ganglia
    homogenates. Additionally, thoracic ganglia homogenates from LPR houseflies
    metabolize more cypermethrin than preparations from susceptible flies. This
    metabolism was inhibited by piperonyl butoxide and a CYP6D1-specific
    antibody. Our results indicate that thoracic ganglia of LPR houseflies are
    protected from the neurotoxin cypermethrin by virtue of the higher levels of
    CYP6D1 compared to the susceptible houseflies. This P450-mediated
    detoxification of an insecticide at the level of the target tissue helps to
    explain the high levels of resistance to pyrethroids in the LPR strain.

    The cytochrome P450 system of animals comprises many individual cytochromes
    P450 in addition to a single cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b(5).
    Although individual genes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily are highly
    diverged, the P450 reductase and cytochrome b(5) remain more conserved
    across taxa. Here, we describe the transformation of Drosophila melanogaster
    with a house-fly-specific cytochrome P450, CYP6D1. Functional activity of
    ectopically expressed cytochromes P450 requires successful interaction
    between the transgenic P450 and the requisite coenzymes of the host
    organism. Transformed Drosophila, but not controls, contained CYP6D1 protein
    as identified by protein immunoblotting, elevated total P450 and elevated
    CYP6D1 enzymatic activity. These data demonstrate that house-fly CYP6D1 can
    interact with low to moderate efficiency with Drosophila P450 reductase and
    cytochrome b(5).

    Rapid advances in sequencing technology have changed the experimental
    landscape of microbial ecology. In the last 10 years, the field has moved
    from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone
    libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using
    next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these
    technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses,
    and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of
    microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing
    variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform,
    which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We
    evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length
    (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural
    samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the
    concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using
    a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used
    to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two
    orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study
    to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and
    sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate
    that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that
    generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing
    coverage for a fraction of the cost.

    Ecdysteroids trigger major developmental transitions in Drosophila,
    including larval molts and metamorphosis. Recent genetic studies strongly
    support a role for the Ecdysteroid receptor (EcR)/Ultraspiracle (USP)
    heterodimer as an ecdysteroid receptor at the onset of metamorphosis,
    functioning as both a transcriptional activator and repressor in vivo.
    Genetic analysis also indicates that USP, like its vertebrate homolog
    retinoid X receptor (RXR), might be involved in regulatory pathways
    independently of EcR. The ecdysteroid hierarchy was also shown recently to
    regulate Drosophila oogenesis and reproduction.

    Recent progress in understanding the principles and mechanisms in olfaction
    is the result of multidisciplinary research efforts that explored
    chemosensation by using a variety of model organisms. Studies on
    invertebrates, notably nematodes, insects, and crustaceans, to which diverse
    experimental approaches can be applied, have greatly helped elucidate
    various aspects of olfactory Signaling. From the converging results of
    genetic, molecular, and physiological studies, a common set of chemosensory
    mechanisms emerges. Recognition and discrimination of odorants as well as
    chemo-electrical transduction and processing of olfactory signals appear to
    be mediated by fundamentally similar mechanisms in phylogenetically diverse
    animals. The common challenge of organisms to decipher the world of odors
    was apparently met: by a phylogenetically conserved strategy. Thus,
    comparative studies should continue to provide important contributions
    toward an understanding of the sense of smell.

    We created a visualization tool called Circos to facilitate the
    identification and analysis of similarities and differences arising from
    comparisons of genomes. Our tool is effective in displaying variation in
    genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships
    between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence
    alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies.
    Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of
    relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode
    the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is
    capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps,
    tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from
    GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be
    easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid
    deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.

    Fertile queens and sterile workers are alternative forms of the adult female
    honeybee that develop from genetically identical larvae following
    differential feeding with royal jelly. We show that silencing the expression
    of DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3, a key driver of epigenetic global
    reprogramming, in newly hatched larvae led to a royal jelly–like effect on
    the larval developmental trajectory; the majority of Dnmt3 small interfering
    RNA–treated individuals emerged as queens with fully developed ovaries. Our
    results suggest that DNA methylation in Apis is used for storing epigenetic
    information, that the use of that information can be differentially altered
    by nutritional input, and that the flexibility of epigenetic modifications
    underpins, profound shifts in developmental fates, with massive implications
    for reproductive and behavioral status.

    Epigenetic modifications that involve methylation cause female honeybee
    larvae to become queens rather than workers when they are fed royal jelly.

    The human microbiome substantially affects many aspects of human physiology,
    including metabolism, drug interactions and numerous diseases. This
    realization, coupled with ever-improving nucleotide sequencing technology,
    has precipitated the collection of diverse data sets that profile the
    microbiome. In the past 2 years, studies have begun to include sufficient
    numbers of subjects to provide the power to associate these microbiome
    features with clinical states using advanced algorithms, increasing the use
    of microbiome studies both individually and collectively. Here we discuss
    tools and strategies for microbiome studies, from primer selection to
    bioinformatics analysis.

    To evaluate the specificity of long dsRNAs used in high-throughput RNA
    interference (RNAi) screens performed at the Drosophila RNAi Screening
    Center (DRSC), we performed a global analysis of their activity in 30
    genome-wide screens completed at our facility. Notably, our analysis
    predicts that dsRNAs containing Z19-nucleotide perfect matches identified in
    silico to unintended targets may contribute to a significant false positive
    error rate arising from off-target effects. We confirmed experimentally that
    such sequences in dsRNAs lead to false positives and to efficient knockdown
    of a cross-hybridizing transcript, raising a cautionary note about
    interpreting results based on the use of a single dsRNA per gene. Although a
    full appreciation of all causes of false positive errors remains to be
    determined, we suggest simple guidelines to help ensure high-quality
    information from RNAi high-throughput screens.

  abstract: >-
    Parasitism by endoparasitoid wasps changes the expression of various host
    genes, and alters host immune and developmental processes. However, it is
    not clearly understood how parasitism changes host gene expression in a
    whole genome scale. This study focused on an epigenetic control of Cotesia
    plutellae, an endoparasitoid wasp, against its host, Plutella xylostella.
    Two DNA methyltransferases (DNMT-1 and DNMT-2) are encoded in the genome of
    P. xylostella. In addition, methyl-binding domain proteins (MBDs) and DNA
    demethylation factor, ten-eleven translation protein (TET) are encoded. DNA
    methylation of P. xylostella genomic DNA was confirmed by restriction
    digestion with Gla I specific to 5-methylcytosine. DNA methylation intensity
    in parasitized (P) larvae was decreased compared to that in nonparasitized
    (NP) larvae, especially at late parasitic stage, at which expression levels
    of both DNMT-1 and DNMT-2 were also decreased. DNA demethylation of P.
    xylostella was confirmed in both NP and P larvae by restriction digestion
    with PvuRts1I recognizing 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine. Parasitism also
    suppressed expression levels of TET and MBDs. Treatment of
    5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA) reduced DNA methylation intensity of NP larvae,
    causing suppression of hemocyte-spreading behavior and delay of immature
    development. RNA interference of DNMT-1 or DNMT-2 mimicked the adverse
    effects of AZA.

  abstract: "For the analysis of microarray data, clustering techniques are frequently used. Most of such methods are based on hard clustering of \n\t\tdata wherein one gene (or sample) is assigned to exactly one cluster. Hard clustering, however, suffers from several drawbacks such as \n\t\tsensitivity to noise and information loss.  In contrast, soft clustering methods can assign a gene to several clusters. They can overcome \n\t\tshortcomings of conventional hard clustering techniques and offer further advantages. Thus, we constructed an R package termed Mfuzz implementing \n\t\tsoft clustering tools for microarray data analysis. The additional package Mfuzzgui provides a convenient TclTk based graphical user interface."

  abstract: >-
    Transcript prediction can be modeled as a graph problem where exons are
    modeled as nodes and reads spanning two or more exons are modeled as exon
    chains. Pacific Biosciences third-generation sequencing technology produces
    significantly longer reads than earlier second-generation sequencing
    technologies, which gives valuable information about longer exon chains in a
    graph. However, with the high error rates of third-generation sequencing,
    aligning long reads correctly around the splice sites is a challenging task.
    Incorrect alignments lead to spurious nodes and arcs in the graph, which in
    turn lead to incorrect transcript predictions. We survey several approaches
    to find the exon chains corresponding to long reads in a splicing graph, and
    experimentally study the performance of these methods using simulated data
    to allow for sensitivity/precision analysis. Our experiments show that short
    reads from second-generation sequencing can be used to significantly improve
    exon chain correctness either by error-correcting the long reads before
    splicing graph creation, or by using them to create a splicing graph on
    which the long-read alignments are then projected. We also study the memory
    and time consumption of various modules, and show that accurate exon chains
    lead to significantly increased transcript prediction accuracy.

  abstract: >-
    The growth of plants depends on continuous function of the meristems. Shoot
    meristems are responsible for all the post-embryonic aerial organs, such as
    leaves, stems and flowers. It has been assumed that the phytohormone
    cytokinin has a positive role in shoot meristem function. A severe reduction
    in the size of meristems in a mutant that is defective in all of its
    cytokinin receptors has provided compelling evidence that cytokinin is
    required for meristem activity. Here, we report a novel regulation of
    meristem activity, which is executed by the meristem-specific activation of
    cytokinins. The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain
    meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of
    the shoot meristem. LOG encodes a novel cytokinin-activating enzyme that
    works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis. Revising the
    long-held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive
    cytokinin nucleotides to the free-base forms, which are biologically active,
    by its cytokinin-specific phosphoribohydrolase activity. LOG messenger RNA
    is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation
    of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain. We propose the fine-tuning
    of concentrations and the spatial distribution of bioactive cytokinins by a
    cytokinin-activating enzyme as a mechanism that regulates meristem activity.

    The aim of Oryzabase is to create a comprehensive view of rice (Oryza
    sativa) as a model monocot plant by integrating biological data with
    molecular genomic information
    (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/top/top.jsp). The database
    contains information about rice development and anatomy, rice mutants, and
    genetic resources, especially for wild varieties of rice. The anatomical
    description of rice development is unique and is the first known
    representation for rice. Developmental and anatomical descriptions include
    in situ gene expression data serving as stage and tissue markers. The
    systematic presentation of a large number of rice mutant and mutant trait
    genes is indispensable, as is description of research in wild strains, core
    collections, and their detailed characterization. Several genetic, physical,
    and expression maps with full genome and cDNA sequences are also combined
    with biological data in Oryzabase. These datasets, when pooled together,
    could provide a useful tool for gaining greater knowledge about the life
    cycle of rice, the relationship between phenotype and gene function, and
    rice genetic diversity. For exchanging community information, Oryzabase
    publishes the Rice Genetics Newsletter organized by the Rice Genetics
    Cooperative and provides a mailing service, rice-e-net/rice-net.

    BACKGROUND:Global analysis of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome is
    facilitated by the recent development of tools for large-scale, highly
    parallel analysis. We describe a novel nucleic acid amplification system
    that generates products by several methods. 3'-Ribo-SPIA primes cDNA
    synthesis at the 3' polyA tail, and whole transcript (WT)-Ribo-SPIA primes
    cDNA synthesis across the full length of the transcripts and thus provides
    whole-transcriptome amplification, independent of the 3' polyA tail.
    METHODS:We developed isothermal linear nucleic acid amplification systems,
    which use a single chimeric primer, for amplification of DNA (SPIA) and RNA
    (Ribo-SPIA). The latter allows mRNA amplification from as little as 1 ng of
    total RNA. Amplification efficiency was calculated based on the delta
    threshold cycle between nonamplified cDNA targets and amplified cDNA. The
    amounts and quality of total RNA and amplification products were determined
    after purification of the amplification products. GeneChip array gene
    expression profiling and real-time PCR were used to test the accuracy and
    reproducibility of the method. Quantification of cDNA products (before and
    after amplification) at the 2 loci along the transcripts was used to assess
    product length (for evaluation of the 3'-initiated Ribo-SPIA) and equal
    representation throughout the length of the transcript (for evaluation of
    the whole transcript amplification system, WT-Ribo-SPIA).
    RESULTS:Ribo-SPIA-based global RNA amplification exhibited linearity over 6
    orders of magnitude of transcript abundance and generated microgram amounts
    of amplified cDNA from as little as 1 ng of total RNA. CONCLUSIONS:The
    described methods enable comprehensive gene expression profiling and
    analysis from limiting biological samples. The WT-Ribo-SPIA procedure, which
    enables amplification of non-polyA-tailed RNA, is suitable for amplification
    and gene expression analysis of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic biological
    samples.

    Here we present Singularity, software developed to bring containers and
    reproducibility to scientific computing. Using Singularity containers,
    developers can work in reproducible environments of their choosing and
    design, and these complete environments can easily be copied and executed on
    other platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the
    expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike, and
    integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these groups. As its
    primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and
    HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and
    compute environments. This ability to create and deploy reproducible
    environments across these centers, a previously unmet need, makes
    Singularity a game changing development for computational science.

    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, a family of detoxifying enzymes, are thought
    to confer resistance to various insecticides including DDT. Daborn et al.
    [Daborn, P., Yen, J.L., Bogwitz, M., Le Goff, G., Feil, et al. 2002. A
    single p450 allele associated with insecticide resistance in Drosophila.
    Science 297, 2253-2256.] suggested that the Accord transposable element
    causes overexpression of a Cyp6g1 allele, which has spread globally and is
    the basis of DDT resistance in Drosophila melanogaster populations. To
    determine whether the same phenomenon also operates in other Drosophila
    strains, we investigated 91-R, 91-C, ry(506), Wisconsin, Canton-SH and
    Hikone-RH strains. While the LC50 values for the 91-R and Wisconsin strains
    are 8348 mu g and 447 mu g of DDT, respectively, values for the other four
    strains range between 0.74 to 20.9 mu g. As expected, the susceptible
    ry(506) and 91-C strains have about 16-33-fold lower levels of CYP6G1 mRNA
    than the resistant 91-R and Wisconsin strains. Surprisingly, CYP6G1 mRNA and
    protein levels in the Canton-SH and Hikone-RH strains are as high as in the
    two resistant strains, yet they are as susceptible as the 91-C strain. The
    susceptible phenotype of the Canton-SH and Hikone-RH strains is not due to
    mutation in the Cyp6g1 gene; sequence analysis showed that Cyp6g1 alleles of
    resistant and susceptible strains are very similar and cannot be classified
    into resistant and susceptible alleles. As observed by others, we also found
    that only the 5'-upstream DNA of overexpressing alleles of Cyp6g1 has an
    insertional DNA, which is similar to Accord and Ninja elements. To examine
    the role of Cyp6g1 in DDT resistance, we substituted the Cyp6g1 allele of
    the 91-R strain with the allele from the susceptible 91-C strain via
    recombination and synthesized three recombinant lines. All three lines
    lacked Accord insertion and showed low expression of Cyp6g1 like the 91-C
    strain, yet they were as highly resistant as the 91-R strain. We conclude a
    strain may not have to have Accord insertion in the Cyp6g1 gene and the
    Cyp6g1 itself may not have to be overexpressed for DDT resistance to occur.

    The grass inflorescence is interesting from the points of view of
    development and evolution. In the grass family, flowers are produced on
    small branches called spikelets. The recent isolation of regulators of
    spikelet meristem (SM) identity has shed new light on development and the
    evolution of the gene networks involved. The timing of SM specification is
    mediated by the combinatorial functions of these regulators, and determines
    the grass inflorescence form. Furthermore, tight links between meristem cell
    proliferation, maintenance of meristem indeterminacy, and suppression of the
    spikelet identity are being uncovered.

  abstract: >-
    In order to clarify the evolutionary relationship of floral organs between
    grasses and dicots, we expressed OsMADS3, a rice (Oryza sativa L.)
    AGAMOUS(AG) ortholog, in rice plants under the control of an Actin1
    promoter. As a consequence of the ectopic expression of the OsMADS3,
    lodicules were homeotically transformed into stamens. In total, the
    transformation of lodicules to staminoid organs was observed in 18 out of 26
    independent transgenic lines. In contrast to the almost complete
    transformation occurring in lodicules, none of the transgenic plants
    exhibited any morphological alterations in the palea or the lemma. Our
    results confirmed the prediction that the lodicule is an equivalent of a
    dicot petal and that the ABC model can be applied to rice at least for organ
    specification in lodicules and stamens.

  abstract: >-
    In the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, the gene doublesex (Agdsx)
    encodes two alternatively spliced transcripts, dsx-female (AgdsxF) and
    dsx-male (AgdsxM), that control differentiation of the two sexes. The female
    transcript, unlike the male, contains an exon (exon 5) whose sequence is
    highly conserved in all Anopheles mosquitoes so far analyzed. We found that
    CRISPR-Cas9-targeted disruption of the intron 4-exon 5 boundary aimed at
    blocking the formation of functional AgdsxF did not affect male development
    or fertility, whereas females homozygous for the disrupted allele showed an
    intersex phenotype and complete sterility. A CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive
    construct targeting this same sequence spread rapidly in caged mosquitoes,
    reaching 100% prevalence within 7-11 generations while progressively
    reducing egg production to the point of total population collapse. Owing to
    functional constraint of the target sequence, no selection of alleles
    resistant to the gene drive occurred in these laboratory experiments.
    Cas9-resistant variants arose in each generation at the target site but did
    not block the spread of the drive.

    The cDNA for human squalene monooxygenase, a key enzyme in the committed
    pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis, was amplified from a human liver cDNA
    library and cloned, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and
    purified. Kinetic analysis of the purified enzyme revealed an apparent K-m
    for squalene of 7.7 mu M and an apparent k(cat) of 1.1 min-1. For FAD the
    apparent K-m is 0.3 mu M, consistent with a loosely bound flavin. The
    apparent K-m for NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, the requisite electron
    transfer partner, is 14 nM. The amount of reductase needed for maximal
    activity is about threefold less than the amount of squalene monooxygenase
    present in the assay; thus, electron transfer to the monooxygenase is not
    likely to be rate limiting. Previous reports have implicated inhibition of
    this enzyme as the cause of a peripheral demyelination seen in weanling rats
    fed a diet containing tellurium. As no data were available for humans, the
    ability of a number of tellurium and related elemental compounds to inhibit
    the recombinant human enzyme was examined. Tellurite, tellurium dioxide,
    selenite, and selenium dioxide were inhibitory; the tellurium compounds were
    more potent than the selenium compounds, as indicated by their IC50 values
    (17 and 37 mu M, respectively). Kinetic analysis of the inhibition by
    tellurite suggests multiple sites of interaction with the enzyme in a
    noncompetitive manner with respect to squalene. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

- id: lambardAromataseTestisExpression2005
  abstract: >-
    The mammalian testis serves two main functions: production of spermatozoa
    and synthesis of steroids, among them estrogens are the end products
    obtained from the irreversible transformation of androgens by aromatase
    (P450arom). In the rat the pattern of P450arom expression differs among the
    testicular somatic cell types according to age; in addition, we have shown
    that gonocytes, spermatogonia, spermatocytes (preleptotene, pachytene),
    spermatids and spermatozoa, represent an important source of estrogens; the
    expression of aromatase is three-fold higher in pachytene spermatocyte (PS)
    compared to gonocytes. In man both Leydig cells and immature germ cells (PS
    and round spermatids, RS) as well as ejaculated spermatozoa expressed a
    biologically active aromatase revealed as a single band of 49 kDa on western
    blots. Up today P450arom has been demonstrated in male germ cells of all
    mammals so far studied (mice, bank vole, bear and monkey). The aromatase
    gene is highly conserved and is unique in humans; its expression is
    regulated in a cell-specific manner via the alternative use of various
    promoters located in the first exon. Nevertheless, data concerning the
    regulation of P450arom especially in germ cells are scarce. We have
    demonstrated that TGF beta inhibits the expression of Cyp19 in PS and RS via
    the SMAD pathway although TNF alpha exerts a stimulatory role in PS, which
    is amplified in presence of dexamethasone. It is noteworthy that
    dexamethasone alone exerts a positive effect on Cyp19 expression in PS and a
    negative one in RS. Cyclic AMP is also a positive regulator of P450arom gene
    expression in germ cells. In addition, we have shown that androgens and
    estrogens modulate Cyp19 gene expression, whatever the testicular cell type
    studied, which favored the presence of androgens and estrogens responsive
    elements on the Cyp19 gene promoter(s). Moreover, in presence of
    seminiferous tubules conditioned media, the amount of aromatase transcripts
    is increased in Leydig cells, therefore, suggesting that other locally
    produced modulators are involved in the regulation of the aromatase gene
    expression and among them the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) from germ
    cells origin is concerned. Using RACE-PCR we have confirmed that promoter II
    directs the expression of aromatase gene, whatever the testicular cell type
    studied in the rat but the involvement of another promoter, such as PIA is
    suggested. Finally, the aromatase gene is constitutively expressed both in
    somatic and germ cells of the testis and the identification of the
    promoter(s) concerned as well as their detailed regions which direct(s) the
    expression of Cyp19 gene is obviously very important but largely unknown
    especially according to the ontogeny of the male gonad. (c) 2005 Elsevier

    In the present study we describe the complete cytochrome P450 complement,
    the "CYPome," of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Eighteen cytochromes P450
    (CYP) are described, in contrast to the absence of CYPs in Escherichia coli,
    and the twenty observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here we confirm
    protein identity as cytochromes P450 by heterologous expression in E. coli
    and measurement of reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra. We also
    report on their arrangement in the linear chromosome and relatedness to
    other CYPs in the superfamily. The future development of manipulation of
    antibiotic pathways and the use of streptomycetes in bioremediation and
    biotransformations will involve many of the new CYP forms identified here.

    Sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (P45051) is the target for azole antifungal

    practical importance, We undertook site-directed mutagenesis of the Candida
    albicans P45051 heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 60
    probe a model structure for the enzyme, The change T315A reduced enzyme
    activity 2-fold as predicted for the removal of the residue that formed a
    hydrogen bond with the 3-OH of the sterol substrate and helped to locate it
    in the active site, This alteration perturbed the heme environment, causing
    an altered reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum with a maximum at 445
    mn. The changes also reduced the affinity of the enzyme for the azole
    antifungals ketoconazole and fluconazole and after expression induced by
    galactose caused 45-fold azole resistance in transformants of S, cerevisiae.
    This is the first example of a single base change in the target enzyme
    conferring resistance to azoles through reduced azole affinity.

    Maize chromosome spreads containing the supernumerary B chromosome were
    hybridized with probes from various repetitive elements including CentC,
    CRM, and CentA, which have been localized to centromeric regions on the A
    chromosomes. Repetitive elements that are enriched or found exclusively near
    the centromeres of A chromosomes hybridized to many sites distinct from the
    centromere on the B chromosome. To examine whether these elements recruit
    kinetochore proteins at locations other than the canonical B centromere,
    cells were labeled with antibodies against CENH3, a key kinetochore protein.
    No labeling was detected outside the normal centromere and no evidence of B
    chromosome holocentromeric activity was observed. This finding suggests
    that, as in other higher eukaryotes, DNA sequence alone is insufficient to
    dictate kinetochore location in plants. Additionally, examination of the B
    centromere region in pachytene chromosomes revealed that the B-specific
    element ZmBs hybridizes to a much larger region than the site of
    hybridization of CentC, CRM, and CentA and the labeling by anti-CENH3
    antibodies.

    <h2>Summary</h2><p>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells can be
    activated via either their T cell receptor (TCR), which recognizes MR1-bound
    pyrimidines derived from microbial riboflavin biosynthesis, or via
    cytokines. These two modes of activation may act in concert or
    independently, depending upon the stimulus. It is unknown, however, how MAIT
    cell responses differ with the mode of activation. Here, we define
    transcriptional and effector responses of human CD8^+^ MAIT cells to TCR and
    cytokine stimulation. We report that MAIT cells rapidly respond to TCR
    stimulation, producing multiple cytokines and chemokines, altering their
    cytotoxic granule content and transcription factor expression, and
    upregulating co-stimulatory proteins. In contrast, cytokine-mediated
    activation is slower and results in a more limited response. Therefore, we
    propose that, in infections by riboflavin-synthesizing bacteria, MAIT cells
    play a key early role in effecting and coordinating immune responses, while
    in the absence of TCR stimulation, their role is likely to differ.</p>

    We have assessed ultraviolet-B (UV-B)-induced injury in wild-type
    Arabidopsis thaliana and two mutants with altered aromatic secondary product
    biosynthesis. Arabidopsis mutants defective in the ability to synthesize
    UV-B-absorbing compounds (flavonoids in transparent testa 5 [tt5] and
    sinapate esters in ferulic acid hydroxylase 1 [fah1]) are more sensitive to
    UV-B than is the wild-type Landsberg erecta. Despite its ability to
    accumulate UV-absorptive flavonoid compounds, the ferulic acid hydroxylase
    mutant fah1 exhibits more physiological injury (growth inhibition and foliar
    lesions) than either wild type or tt5. The extreme UV-B sensitivity of fah1
    demonstrates the importance of hydroxycinnamate esters as UV-B protectants.
    Consistent with the whole-plant response, the highest levels of lipid and
    protein oxidation products were seen in fah1. Ascorbate peroxidase enzyme
    activity was also increased in the leaves of UV-B-treated plants in a dose-
    and genotype-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that, in A.
    thaliana, hydroxycinnamates are more effective UV-B protectants than
    flavonoids. The data also indicate that A. thaliana responds to UV-B as an
    oxidative stress, and sunscreen compounds reduce the oxidative damage caused
    by UV-B.

  abstract: >-
    Photolyases are DNA repair enzymes that use energy from blue light to repair
    pyrimidine dimers. We report the isolation of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant
    (uvr2-1) that is defective in photorepair of cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers
    (CPDs). Whereas uvr2-1 is indistinguishable from wild type in the absence of
    UV light, low UV-B levels inhibit growth and cause leaf necrosis. uvr2-1 is
    more sensitive to UV-B than wild type when placed under white light after
    UV-B treatment. In contrast, recovery in darkness or in light lacking
    photoreactivating blue light results in equal injury in uvr2-1 and wild
    type. The uvr2-1 mutant is unable to remove CPDs in vivo, and plant extracts
    lack detectable photolyase activity. This recessive mutation segregates as a
    single gene located near the top of chromosome 1, and is a structural gene
    mutation in the type II CPD photolyase PHR1. This mutant provides evidence
    that CPD photolyase is required for plant survival in the presence of UV-B
    light.

  abstract: >-
    Fruit flies are attracted by a diversity of odors that signal the presence
    of food, potential mates, or attractive egg-laying sites. Most Drosophila
    olfactory neurons express two types of odorant receptor genes: Or83b, a
    broadly expressed receptor of unknown function, and one or more members of a
    family of 61 selectively expressed receptors. While the conventional odorant
    receptors are highly divergent, Or83b is remarkably conserved between insect
    species. Two models could account for Or83b function: it could interact with
    specific odor stimuli independent of conventional odorant receptors, or it
    could act in concert with these receptors to mediate responses to all odors.
    Our results support the second model. Dendritic localization of conventional
    odorant receptors is abolished in Or83b mutants. Consistent with this
    cellular defect, the Or83b mutation disrupts behavioral and
    electrophysiological responses to many odorants. Or83b therefore encodes an
    atypical odorant receptor that plays an essential general role in olfaction.

    MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that control gene function
    posttranscriptionally through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition.
    Much has been learned about the processing and mechanism of action of
    microRNAs, but little is known about their biological function. Here, we
    demonstrate that injection of 2'O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides into
    early Drosophila embryos leads to specific and efficient depletion of
    microRNAs and thus permits systematic loss-of-function analysis in vivo.
    Twenty-five of the forty-six embryonically expressed microRNAs show readily
    discernible defects; pleiotropy is moderate and family members display
    similar yet distinct phenotypes. Processes under microRNA regulation include
    cellularization and patterning in the blastoderm, morphogenesis, and cell
    survival. The largest microRNA family in Drosophila (miR-2/6/11/13/308) is
    required for suppressing embryonic apoptosis; this is achieved by
    differential posttranscriptional repression of the proapoptotic factors hid,
    grim, reaper, and sickle. Our findings demonstrate that microRNAs act as
    specific and essential regulators in a wide range of developmental
    processes.

  abstract: >-
    Sex determination is a fundamental developmental pathway governing male and
    female differentiation, with profound implications for morphology,
    reproductive strategies, and behavior. In animals, sex differences between
    males and females are generally determined by genetic factors carried by sex
    chromosomes. Sex chromosomes are remarkably variable in origin and can
    differ even between closely related species, indicating that transitions
    occur frequently and independently in different groups of organisms. The
    evolutionary causes underlying sex chromosome turnover are poorly
    understood, however. Here we provide evidence indicating that Wolbachia
    bacterial endosymbionts triggered the evolution of new sex chromosomes in
    the common pillbug Armadillidium vulgare. We identified a 3-Mb insert of a
    feminizing Wolbachia genome that was recently transferred into the pillbug
    nuclear genome. The Wolbachia insert shows perfect linkage to the female
    sex, occurs in a male genetic background (i.e., lacking the ancestral W
    female sex chromosome), and is hemizygous. Our results support the
    conclusion that the Wolbachia insert is now acting as a female
    sex-determining region in pillbugs, and that the chromosome carrying the
    insert is a new W sex chromosome. Thus, bacteria-to-animal horizontal genome
    transfer represents a remarkable mechanism underpinning the birth of sex
    chromosomes. We conclude that sex ratio distorters, such as Wolbachia
    endosymbionts, can be powerful agents of evolutionary transitions in sex
    determination systems in animals.

    Double-stranded RNA induces sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression
    at a posttranscriptional level in eukaryotes (RNAi). This natural phenomenon
    has been developed into a tool for studying gene function in several model
    organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. Transgenes bearing inverted
    repeats are able to exert an RNAi effect in Drosophila, but cloning
    difficulties and inconsistent silencing complicate the method. We have
    constructed a transgene containing inverted repeats separated by a
    functional intron such that mRNA produced by the transgene is predicted to
    form loopless hairpin RNA following splicing. A single copy of the transgene
    effectively and uniformly silences expression of a target gene (white) in
    transgenic flies. We have developed a vector that is designed to produce
    intron-spliced hairpin RNA corresponding to any Drosophila gene. The vector
    is under control of the upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the yeast
    transcriptional activator GAL4. The UAS/GAL4 system allows hairpin RNA to
    conditionally silence gene expression in Drosophila in a tissue-specific
    manner. Moreover, the presence of the intron spacer greatly enhances the
    stability of inverted-repeat sequences in bacteria, facilitating the cloning
    procedure.

    We describe a genetic mosaic system in Drosophila, in which a dominant
    repressor of a cell marker is placed in trans to a mutant gene of interest.
    Mitotic recombination events between homologous chromosomes generate
    homozygous mutant cells, which are exclusively labeled due to loss of the
    repressor. Using this system, we are able to visualize axonal projections
    and dendritic elaboration in large neuroblast clones and single neuron
    clones with a membrane-targeted GFP marker. This new method allows for the
    study of gene functions in neuroblast proliferation, axon guidance, and
    dendritic elaboration in the complex central nervous system. As an example,
    we show that the short stop gene is required in mushroom body neurons for
    the extension and guidance of their axons.

    Regulating the transition of meristem identity is a critical step in
    reproductive development. After the shoot apical meristem (SAM) acquires
    inflorescence meristem identity, it goes through a sequential transition to
    second- and higher-order meristems that can eventually give rise to floral
    organs. Despite ample information on the molecular mechanisms that control
    the transition from SAM to inflorescence meristems, little is known about
    the mechanism for inflorescence development, especially in monocots. Here,
    we report the identification of the SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) gene
    controlling the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem and the
    floral organ development. This gene encodes a putative transcription factor
    carrying two AP2 domains. The SNB:GFP fusion protein is localized to the
    nucleus. SNB is expressed in all the examined tissues, but most strongly in
    the newly emerging spikelet meristems. In SNB knockout plants, the
    transition from spikelet meristems to floral meristems is delayed, resulting
    in the production of multiple rudimentary glumes in an alternative
    phyllotaxy. The development of additional bracts interferes with subsequent
    floral architecture. In some spikelets, the empty glumes and lodicules are
    transformed into lemma/palea-like organs. Occasionally, the number of
    stamens and carpels is altered and an ectopic floret occurs in the axil of
    the rachilla. These phenotypes suggest that snb is a heterochronic mutant,
    affecting the phase transition of spikelet meristems, the pattern formation
    of floral organs and spikelet meristem determinancy.

    We report a systematic RNA interference (RNAi) screen of 5,690
    Caenorhabditis elegans genes for gene inactivations that increase lifespan.
    We found that genes important for mitochondrial function stand out as a
    principal group of genes affecting C. elegans lifespan. A classical genetic
    screen identified a mutation in the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase
    gene (lrs-2) that impaired mitochondrial function and was associated with
    longer-lifespan. The long-lived worms with impaired mitochondria had lower
    ATP content and oxygen consumption, but differential responses to
    free-radical and other stresses. These data suggest that the longer lifespan
    of C. elegans with compromised mitochrondria cannot simply be assigned to
    lower free radical production and suggest a more complex coupling of
    metabolism and longevity.

    Meristem identity is crucial in determining the inflorescence architecture
    of grass species. We previously reported that SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB)
    regulates the transition of spikelet meristems into floral meristems in rice
    (Oryza sativa). Here we demonstrated that SNB and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE
    SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1) together play important roles in inflorescence
    architecture and the establishment of floral meristems. In snb osids1 double
    mutants, the numbers of branches and spikelets within a panicle are
    significantly decreased, and the transition to a floral meristem is further
    delayed compared with the snb single mutant. Expression analyses showed that
    SNB and OsIDS1 are required for spatio-temporal expression of B- and
    E-function floral organ identity genes in the lodicules. In addition, the
    AP2 family genes are important for determining the degree of ramification in
    branch meristems, regulating the spatio-temporal expression of spikelet
    meristem genes, such as FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP). Furthermore, overexpression of
    microRNA172 (miR172) causes reductions in SNB and OsIDS1 transcript levels,
    and phenotypes of the transgenic plants are more severe than for snb osids1.
    This indicates that additional gene(s) participate in the development of
    branch and floral meristems. Preferential expression of mature miR172s in
    the area around the spikelet meristems implies that depletion of the AP2
    family genes in those meristems via miR172 is an important step in
    controlling inflorescence branching and the formation of floral organs.

    ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Nocturnal insects such as moths are ideal models to
    study the molecular bases of olfaction that they use, among examples, for
    the detection of mating partners and host plants. Knowing how an odour
    generates a neuronal signal in insect antennae is crucial for understanding
    the physiological bases of olfaction, and also could lead to the
    identification of original targets for the development of olfactory-based
    control strategies against herbivorous moth pests. Here, we describe an
    Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) project to characterize the antennal
    transcriptome of the noctuid pest model, Spodoptera littoralis, and to
    identify candidate genes involved in odour/pheromone detection. RESULTS: By
    targeting cDNAs from male antennae, we biased gene discovery towards genes
    potentially involved in male olfaction, including pheromone reception. A
    total of 20760 ESTs were obtained from a normalized library and were
    assembled in 9033 unigenes. 6530 were annotated based on BLAST analyses and
    gene prediction software identified 6738 ORFs. The unigenes were compared to
    the Bombyx mori proteome and to ESTs derived from Lepidoptera transcriptome
    projects. We identified a large number of candidate genes involved in odour
    and pheromone detection and turnover, including 31 candidate chemosensory
    receptor genes, but also genes potentially involved in olfactory modulation.
    CONCLUSIONS: Our project has generated a large collection of antennal
    transcripts from a Lepidoptera. The normalization process, allowing
    enrichment in low abundant genes, proved to be particularly relevant to
    identify chemosensory receptors in a species for which no genomic data are
    available. Our results also suggest that olfactory modulation can take place
    at the level of the antennae itself. These EST resources will be invaluable
    for exploring the mechanisms of olfaction and pheromone detection in S.
    littoralis, and for ultimately identifying original targets to fight against
    moth herbivorous pests.

    Insecticide resistance in laboratory selected Drosophila strains has been
    associated with upregulation of a range of different cytochrome P450s,
    however in recent field isolates of D. melanogaster resistance to DDT and
    other compounds is conferred by one P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Using microarray
    analysis of all Drosophila P450 genes, here we show that different P450
    genes such as Cyp12d1 and Cyp6a8 can also be selected using DDT in the
    laboratory. We also show, however, that a homolog of Cyp6g1 is
    over-expressed in a field resistant strain of D. simulans. In order to
    determine why Cyp6g1 is so widely selected in the field we examine the
    pattern of cross-resistance of both resistant strains and transgenic flies
    over-expressing Cyp6g1 alone. We show that all three DDT selected P450s can
    confer resistance to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid but that Cyp6a8 confers
    no cross-resistance to malathion. Transgenic flies over-expressing Cyp6g1
    also show cross-resistance to other neonicotinoids such as acetamiprid and
    nitenpyram. We suggest that the broad level of cross-resistance shown by
    Cyp6g1 may have facilitated its selection as a resistance gene in natural
    Drosophila populations.

  abstract: >-
    The massive use of DDT as an insecticide between 1940 and 1970 has resulted
    in the emergence of a resistant population of insects. One of the main
    metabolic mechanisms developed by resistant insects involves detoxification
    enzymes such as cytochrome P450s. These enzymes can metabolise the
    insecticide to render it less toxic and facilitate its elimination from the
    organism. The P450 Cyp6g1 was identified as the major factor responsible for
    DDT resistance in Drosophila melanogaster field populations. In this
    article, we review the data available for this gene since it was associated
    with resistance in 2002. The knowledge gained on Cyp6g1 allows a better
    understanding of the evolution of insecticide resistance mechanisms and
    highlights the major role of transposable elements in evolutionary
    processes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

    The effect of xenobiotics (phenobarbital and atrazine) on the expression of
    Drosophila melanogaster CYP genes encoding cytochromes P450, a gene family
    generally associated with detoxification, was analyzed by DNA microarray
    hybridization and verified by real-time RT-PCR in adults of both sexes. Only
    a small subset of the 86 CYP genes was significantly induced by the
    xenobiotics. Eleven CYP genes and three glutathione S-transferases (GST)
    genes were significantly induced by phenobarbital, seven CYP and one GST
    gene were induced by atrazine. Cyp6d5, Cyp6w1, Cyp12d1 and the
    ecdysone-inducible Cyp6a2 were induced by both chemicals. The constitutive
    expression of several of the inducible genes (Cyp6a2, Cyp6a8, Cyp6d5,
    Cyp12d1) was higher in males than in females, and the induced level similar
    in both sexes. Thus, the level of induction was consistently higher in
    females than in males. The female-specific and hormonally regulated yolk
    protein genes were significantly induced by phenobarbital in males and
    repressed by atrazine in females. Our, results suggest that the numerous CYP
    genes of Drosophila respond selectively to xenobiotics, providing the fly
    with an adaptive response to chemically adverse environments. The xenobiotic
    inducibility of some CYP genes previously associated with insecticide
    resistance in laboratory-selected strains (Cyp6a2, Cyp6a8, Cyp12d1) suggests
    that deregulation of P450 gene expression may be a facile way to achieve
    resistance. Our study also suggests that xenobiotic-induced changes in P450
    levels can affect insect fitness by interfering with hormonally regulated
    networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    Plants continuously maintain pools of totipotent stem cells in their apical
    meristems from which elaborate root and shoot systems are produced. In
    Arabidopsis thaliana, stem cell fate in the shoot apical meristem is
    controlled by a regulatory network that includes the CLAVATA (CLV)
    ligand-receptor system and the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS).
    Phytohormones such as auxin and cytokinin are also important for meristem
    regulation. Here we show a mechanistic link between the CLV/WUS network and
    hormonal control. WUS, a positive regulator of stem cells, directly
    represses the transcription of several two-component ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE
    REGULATOR genes (ARR5, ARR6, ARR7 and ARR15), which act in the
    negative-feedback loop of cytokinin signalling. These data indicate that ARR
    genes might negatively influence meristem size and that their repression by
    WUS might be necessary for proper meristem function. Consistent with this
    hypothesis is our observation that a mutant ARR7 allele, which mimics the
    active, phosphorylated form, causes the formation of aberrant shoot apical
    meristems. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in a maize ARR homologue
    was recently shown to cause enlarged meristems.

    Transcriptional regulation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) by Nrf2
    is important for the cellular adaptive response to toxic insults. New data
    show that primary skin-derived fibroblasts from the long-lived Snell dwarf
    mutant mouse, previously shown to be resistant to many toxic stresses, have
    elevated levels of Nrf2 and of multiple Nrf2-sensitive ARE genes.
    Dwarf-derived fibroblasts exhibit many of the traits associated with
    enhanced activity of Nrf2/ARE, including higher levels of glutathione and
    resistance to plasma membrane lipid peroxidation. Treatment of control cells
    with arsenite, an inducer of Nrf2 activity, increases their resistance to
    paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, cadmium, and UV light, rendering these cells as
    stress resistant as untreated cells from dwarf mice. Furthermore, mRNA
    levels for some Nrf2-sensitive genes are elevated in at least some tissues
    of Snell dwarf mice, suggesting that the phenotypes observed in culture may
    be mirrored in vivo. Augmented activity of Nrf2 and ARE-responsive genes may
    coordinate many of the stress resistance traits seen in cells from these
    long-lived mutant mice.

  abstract: >-
    One of the most remarkable manifestations of plant evolution is the
    diversity for floral branching systems. These “inflorescences” arise from
    stem cell populations in shoot meristems that mature gradually to
    reproductive states in response to environmental and endogenous signals. The
    morphology of the shoot meristem maturation process is conserved across
    distantly related plants, raising the question of how diverse inflorescence
    architectures arise from seemingly common maturation programs. In tomato and
    related nightshades (Solanaceae), inflorescences range from solitary flowers
    to highly branched structures bearing hundreds of flowers. Since
    reproductive barriers between even closely related Solanaceae have precluded
    a genetic dissection, we captured and compared meristem maturation
    transcriptomes from five domesticated and wild species reflecting the
    evolutionary continuum of inflorescence complexity. We find these divergent
    species share hundreds of dynamically expressed genes, enriched for
    transcription factors. Meristem stages are defined by distinct molecular
    states and point to modified maturation schedules underlying architectural
    variation. These modified schedules are marked by a peak of transcriptome
    expression divergence during the reproductive transition, driven by
    heterochronic shifts of dynamic genes, including transcriptional regulators
    with known roles in flowering. Thus, evolutionary diversity in Solanaceae
    inflorescence complexity is determined by subtle modifications of
    transcriptional programs during a critical transitional window of meristem
    maturation, which we propose underlies similar cases of plant architectural
    variation. More broadly, our findings parallel the recently described
    transcriptome “inverse hourglass” model for animal embryogenesis, suggesting
    both plant and animal morphological variation is guided by a mid-development
    period of transcriptome divergence.

    The genus Wolbachia is an archetype of maternally inherited intracellular
    bacteria that infect the germline of numerous invertebrate species
    worldwide. They can selfishly alter arthropod sex ratios and reproductive
    strategies to increase the proportion of the infected matriline in the
    population. The most common reproductive manipulation is cytoplasmic
    incompatibility, which results in embryonic lethality in crosses between
    infected males and uninfected females. Females infected with the same
    Wolbachia strain rescue this lethality. Despite more than 40 years of
    research and relevance to symbiont-induced speciation, as well as control of
    arbovirus vectors and agricultural pests, the bacterial genes underlying
    cytoplasmic incompatibility remain unknown. Here we use comparative and
    transgenic approaches to demonstrate that two differentially transcribed,
    co-diverging genes in the eukaryotic association module of prophage WO from
    Wolbachia strain wMel recapitulate and enhance cytoplasmic incompatibility.
    Dual expression in transgenic, uninfected males of Drosophila melanogaster
    crossed to uninfected females causes embryonic lethality. Each gene
    additively augments embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males
    and uninfected females. Lethality associates with embryonic defects that
    parallel those of wild-type cytoplasmic incompatibility and is notably
    rescued by wMel-infected embryos in all cases. The discovery of cytoplasmic
    incompatibility factor genes cifA and cifB pioneers genetic studies of
    prophage WO-induced reproductive manipulations and informs the continuing
    use of Wolbachia to control dengue and Zika virus transmission to humans.

    Strand-specific, massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful
    tool for transcript discovery, genome annotation and expression profiling.
    There are multiple published methods for strand-specific RNA-seq, but no
    consensus exists as to how to choose between them. Here we developed a
    comprehensive computational pipeline to compare library quality metrics from
    any RNA-seq method. Using the well-annotated Saccharomyces cerevisiae
    transcriptome as a benchmark, we compared seven library-construction
    protocols, including both published and our own methods. We found marked
    differences in strand specificity, library complexity, evenness and
    continuity of coverage, agreement with known annotations and accuracy for
    expression profiling. Weighing each method's performance and ease, we
    identified the dUTP second-strand marking and the Illumina RNA ligation
    methods as the leading protocols, with the former benefitting from the
    current availability of paired-end sequencing. Our analysis provides a
    comprehensive benchmark, and our computational pipeline is applicable for
    assessment of future protocols in other organisms.

    mechanism are small RNAs (sRNAs) of 21-24 nt that guide the silencing
    machinery to their nucleic acid targets in a nucleotide sequence-specific
    manner. Transcriptional gene silencing is associated with 24-nt sRNAs and
    RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) at cytosine residues in three DNA
    sequence contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH). We previously demonstrated that 24-nt
    sRNAs are mobile from shoot to root in Arabidopsis thaliana and confirmed
    that they mediate DNA methylation at three sites in recipient cells. In this
    study, we extend this finding by demonstrating that RdDM of thousands of
    loci in root tissues is dependent upon mobile sRNAs from the shoot and that
    mobile sRNA-dependent DNA methylation occurs predominantly in non-CG
    contexts. Mobile sRNA-dependent non-CG methylation is largely dependent on
    the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASES 1/2 (DRM1/DRM2) RdDM pathway but
    is independent of the CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT)2/3 DNA methyltransferases.
    Specific superfamilies of TEs, including those typically found in gene-rich
    euchromatic regions, lose DNA methylation in a mutant lacking 22- to 24-nt
    sRNAs (dicer-like 2, 3, 4 triple mutant). Transcriptome analyses identified
    a small number of genes whose expression in roots is associated with mobile
    sRNAs and connected to DNA methylation directly or indirectly. Finally, we
    demonstrate that sRNAs from shoots of one accession move across a graft
    union and target DNA methylation de novo at normally unmethylated sites in
    the genomes of root cells from a different accession.

    Rice is the world's most important staple grown by millions of small-holder
    farmers. Sustaining rice production relies on the intelligent use of rice
    diversity. The 3,000 Rice Genomes Project is a giga-dataset of publically
    available genome sequences (averaging 14× depth of coverage) derived from
    3,000 accessions of rice with global representation of genetic and
    functional diversity. The seed of these accessions is available from the
    International Rice Genebank Collection. Together, they are an unprecedented
    resource for advancing rice science and breeding technology. Our immediate
    challenge now is to comprehensively and systematically mine this dataset to
    link genotypic variation to functional variation with the ultimate goal of
    creating new and sustainable rice varieties that can support a future world
    population that will approach 9.6 billion by 2050.

  abstract: >-
    Depressaria pastinacella, the parsnip webworm, a specialist on two genera in
    the Apiaceae, routinely consumes plant tissues high in furanocoumarin
    content and is capable of rapid cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification of
    these compounds. In this study, four cDNAs were cloned from the larval
    midgut of this insect: two full-length CYP6AB3 and CYP6AE1 cDNAs are closely
    related to members of the furanocoumarin-metabolizing CYP6B subfamily and
    two partial CYP9A6 and CYP9A7 cDNAs are related to members of the CYP9A
    subfamily that have also been linked to the detoxification of xenobiotics.
    At least one of these P450s (CYP6AB3) is inducible by dietary
    furanocoumarins, indicating its potential involvement in furanocoumarin
    metabolism. A homology model of CYP6AB3 was constructed and compared to
    models of CYP6B1 from the specialist species, Papilio polyxenes, and CYP6B4
    from the generalist species, P. glaucus. Structural superpositioning of
    these models has revealed very high spatial similarity of elements,
    including the B helix, B'-C loop, I helix and C-terminal domain, within the
    catalytic sites of these proteins. Most importantly, key amino acid residues
    that can potentially come into contact with furanocoumarin substrates
    display conservation in their spatial positioning and side chain polarities.
    Three of these residues, Val103, Leu113 and Phe118 (numbered according to
    CYP6AB3), are conserved in all three of these proteins, further implicating
    CYP6AB3 in furanocoumarin metabolism by parsnip webworms. Characterization
    of these P450 cDNAs will allow for functional analyses aimed at elucidating
    the molecular mechanisms underlying the coevolutionary interactions between
    this herbivore and its principal host plant.

    Since the completion of the cucumber and panda genome projects using
    Illumina sequencing in 2009, the global scientific community has had to pay
    much more attention to this new cost-effective approach to generate the
    draft sequence of large genomes. To allow new users to more easily
    understand the assembly algorithms and the optimum software packages for
    their projects, we make a detailed comparison of the two major classes of
    assembly algorithms: overlap–layout–consensus and de-bruijn-graph, from how
    they match the Lander–Waterman model, to the required sequencing depth and
    reads length. We also discuss the computational efficiency of each class of
    algorithm, the influence of repeats and heterozygosity and points of note in
    the subsequent scaffold linkage and gap closure steps. We hope this review
    can help further promote the application of second-generation de novo
    sequencing, as well as aid the future development of assembly algorithms.

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450) are membrane-bound hemoproteins that
    play important roles in conferring protection against both naturally
    occurring phytochemicals and synthetic organic insecticides. Despite the
    potential for common modes of detoxification, cross-resistance between
    phytochemicals and synthetic organic insecticides has rarely been
    documented. In this study, we examined the responses of a susceptible strain
    of corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), a polyphagous noctuid, to
    exposure by an allelochemical infrequently encountered in its host plants
    and by an insecticide widely used for control purposes. Within a single
    generation, survivors of xanthotoxin exposure displayed higher levels of
    tolerance to alpha-cypermethrin than did unexposed control larvae. The F1
    offspring of xanthotoxin-exposed survivors also displayed higher
    alpha-cypermethrin tolerance than did offspring of unexposed control larvae,
    suggesting that increased alpha-cypermethrin tolerance after xanthotoxin
    exposure represents, at least in part, heritable resistance. Administration
    of piperonyl butoxide, a P450 synergist, demonstrated that resistance to
    both xanthotoxin and alpha-cypermethrin is P450-mediated.
    Alpha-cypermethrin-exposed survivors, however, failed to show superior
    growth on xanthotoxin diets. Assays with control larvae, larvae induced by
    both xanthotoxin and alpha-cypermethrin, and survivors of LD50 doses of both
    compounds indicated that H. zea midgut P450s are capable of metabolizing
    both xanthotoxin and alpha-cypermethrin. Metabolism of each compound is
    significantly inhibited by the presence of the other compound, suggesting
    that at least one form of P450 in H. zea midguts degrades both compounds and
    may constitute the biochemical basis for possible cross-resistance. Compared
    with control larvae, xanthotoxin- and alpha-cypermethrin-induced larvae
    displayed 2- to 4-fold higher P450-mediated metabolism of both compounds.
    However, xanthotoxin- and alpha-cypermethrin-exposed survivors exhibited
    much higher (2.5- to 11-fold) metabolism of both compounds than did the
    induced larvae. The metabolism results, like the bioassay results, are
    consistent with the interpretation that increased alpha-cypermethrin
    tolerance after xanthotoxin exposure is attributable mainly to heritable
    resistance.

    Many differential gene expression analyses are conducted with an inadequate
    number of biological replicates. We describe an easy and effective RNA-seq
    approach using molecular barcoding to enable profiling of a large number of
    replicates simultaneously. This approach significantly improves the
    performance of differential gene expression analysis. Using this approach in
    medaka (Oryzias latipes), we discover novel genes with sexually dimorphic
    expression and genes necessary for germ cell development. Our results also
    demonstrate why the common practice of using only three replicates in
    differential gene expression analysis should be abandoned.

  abstract: >-
    Diversification of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) is thought to
    result from antagonistic interactions between plants and their herbivorous
    enemies. However, little direct evidence demonstrates the relationship
    between selection by plant toxins and adaptive changes in herbivore P450s.
    Here we show that the furanocournarin-metabolic activity of CYP6B proteins
    in two species of swallowtail caterpillars is associated with the
    probability of encountering host plant furanocoumarins. Catalytic activity
    was compared in two closely related CYP6B4 and CYP6B17 groups in the
    polyphagous congeners Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis. Generally,
    P450s from P. glaucus, which feeds occasionally on furanocoumarin-containing
    host plants, display higher activities against furanocoumarins than those
    from P. canadensis, which normally does not encounter furanocoumarins. These
    P450s in turn catalyze a larger range of furanocoumarins at lower efficiency
    than CYP6B1, a P450 from Papilio polyxenes, which feeds exclusively on
    furanocoumarin-containing host plants. Reconstruction of the ancestral CYP6B
    sequences using maximum likelihood predictions and comparisons of the
    sequence and geometry of their active sites to those of contemporary CYP6B
    proteins indicate that host plant diversity is directly related to P450
    activity and inversely related to substrate specificity. These predictions
    suggest that, along the lineage leading to Papilio P450s, the ancestral,
    highly versatile CYP6B protein presumed to exist in a polyphagous species
    evolved through time into a more efficient and specialized CYP6B1-like
    protein in Papilio species with continual exposure to furanocoumarins.
    Further diversification of Papilio CYP6Bs has likely involved interspersed
    events of positive selection in oligophagous species and relaxation of
    functional constraints in polyphagous species.

    We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of
    whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel
    sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with
    Hi-C at a resolution of 1Mb. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome
    territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene rich chromosomes. We
    identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized
    by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two
    genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation
    is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free conformation that enables
    maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and
    unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more
    commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power
    of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.

    Even though vast amounts of genome-wide gene expression data have become
    available in plants, it remains a challenge to effectively mine this
    information for the discovery of genes and gene networks, for instance those
    that control agronomically important traits. These networks reflect
    potential interactions among genes and, therefore, can lead to a systematic
    understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying targeted biological
    processes. We discuss methods to analyze gene networks using gene expression
    data, specifically focusing on four common statistical approaches used to
    reconstruct networks: correlation, feature selection in supervised learning,
    probabilistic graphical model, and meta-prediction. In addition, we discuss
    the effective use of these methods for acquiring an in-depth understanding
    of biological systems in plants.

    The revolutionary RNA-guided endonuclease CRISPR/Cas9 system has proven to
    be a powerful tool for gene editing in a plethora of organisms. Here,
    utilizing this system we developed an efficient protocol for the generation
    of heritable germline mutations in the parasitoid jewel wasp, Nasonia
    vitripennis, a rising insect model organism for the study of evolution,
    development of axis pattern formation, venom production, haplo-diploid sex
    determination, and host–symbiont interactions. To establish CRISPR-directed
    gene editing in N. vitripennis, we targeted a conserved eye pigmentation
    gene cinnabar, generating several independent heritable germline mutations
    in this gene. Briefly, to generate these mutants, we developed a protocol to
    efficiently collect N. vitripennis eggs from a parasitized flesh fly pupa,
    Sarcophaga bullata, inject these eggs with Cas9/guide RNA mixtures, and
    transfer injected eggs back into the host to continue development. We also
    describe a flow for screening mutants and establishing stable mutant strains
    through genetic crosses. Overall, our results demonstrate that the
    CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome manipulation in N.
    vitripennis, with strong potential for expansion to target critical genes,
    thus allowing for the investigation of several important biological
    phenomena in this organism.

    humans, resulting from its restricted bioavailability for plants and,
    subsequently, low Fe concentration in edible plant parts. Plants have
    evolved sophisticated mechanisms to alleviate Fe deficiency, with the aim of
    recalibrating metabolic fluxes and maintaining cellular Fe homeostasis. To
    analyze condition-sensitive changes in precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing
    pattern, we mapped the transcriptome of Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient
    Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots using the RNA sequencing technology
    and a newly developed software toolbox, the Read Analysis & Comparison Kit
    in Java (RACKJ). In alternatively spliced genes, stress-related Gene
    Ontology categories were overrepresented, while housekeeping cellular
    functions were mainly transcriptionally controlled. Fe deficiency increased
    the complexity of the splicing pattern and triggered the differential
    alternative splicing of 313 genes, the majority of which had differentially
    retained introns. Several genes with important functions in Fe acquisition
    and homeostasis were both differentially expressed and differentially
    alternatively spliced upon Fe deficiency, indicating a complex regulation of
    gene activity in Fe-deficient conditions. A comparison with a data set for
    phosphate-deficient plants suggests that changes in splicing patterns are
    nutrient specific and not or not chiefly caused by stochastic fluctuations.
    In sum, our analysis identified extensive posttranscriptional control,
    biasing the abundance and activity of proteins in a condition-dependent
    manner. The production of a mixture of functional and nonfunctional
    transcripts may provide a means to fine-tune the abundance of transcripts
    with critical importance in cellular Fe homeostasis. It is assumed that
    differential gene expression and nutrient deficiency-induced changes in
    pre-mRNA splicing represent parallel, but potentially interacting,
    regulatory mechanisms.

    Objectives To determine die overall rate of loss of workplace teaspoons and
    whether attrition and displacernent are correlated with the relative value
    of the teaspoons or type of tearoom.Design Longitudinal cohort study.Setting
    Research institute employing about 140 people.Subjects 70 discreetly
    numbered teaspoons placed in tearooms around the institute and observed
    weekly over five months.Main outcome measures Incidence of teaspoon loss per
    100 teaspoon years and teaspoon half life.Results 56 (80%) of the 70
    teaspoons disappeared during the study The half life of the teaspoons was 81
    days. The half life of teaspoons in communal tearooms (42 days) was
    significantly shorter than for those in rooms associated with particular
    research groups (77 days). The rate of loss was not influenced by the
    teaspoons' value. The incidence of teaspoon loss over the period of
    observation was 360.62 per 100 teaspoon years. At this rate, an estimated
    250 teaspoons would need to be purchased annually to maintain a practical
    institute-wide population of 70 teaspoons.Conclusions The loss of workplace
    teaspoons was rapid, showing that their availability, and hence office
    culture in general, is constantly threatened.

    Papilio glaucus (eastern tiger swallowtail) and Papilio. canadensis
    (Canadian tiger swallowtail) are two closely related species with broad but
    overlapping hostplant ranges. P. glaucus encounters toxic furanocoumarins
    occasionally in its diet in its rutaceous hostplants, whereas P. canadensis
    rarely if ever encounters these Compounds. Analysis of their
    furanocoumarin-metabolic profiles indicates that these species induce
    cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) capable of metabolizing linear and
    angular furanocoumarins to varying degrees in response to dietary
    supplementation with xanthotoyin (a linear furanocoumarin). In P. glaucus,
    metabolism is induced to a significantly higher level than in A canadensis.
    Cloning of multiple P450 genes from each species has revealed that both
    species contain and express two groups of P450s, designated CYP6B4 and
    CYP6B17, that are related to the A glaucus CYP6B4v1 enzyme known to
    metabolize an array of furanocoumarins. Expression patterns of the CYP6B4
    and CYP6B17 group transcripts differ in these species in both their basal
    and furanocoumarin-inducible levels. In P. glaucus, CYP6B4 transcripts,
    which are not detectable constitutively, are 311-fold induced by xanthotoxin
    and CYP6B17 transcripts, which are detectable constitutively, are 3-fold
    induced by xanthotoxin. In P. canadensis, CYP6B4 transcripts are only 8-fold
    induced and CYP6B17 transcripts are 13-fold induced. These findings are
    consistent with the postulated evolutionary history of these two species,
    according to which P. glaucus maintains its association with rutaceous
    hostplants and P. canadensis has differentiated to utilize hostplants in
    other families more extensively (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

    Xenobiotic resistance in insects has evolved predominantly by increasing the
    metabolic capability of detoxificative systems and/or reducing xenobiotic
    target site sensitivity. In contrast to the limited range of nucleotide
    changes that lead to target site insensitivity, many molecular mechanisms
    lead to enhancements in xenobiotic metabolism. The genomic changes that lead
    to amplification, overexpression, and coding sequence variation in the three
    major groups of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, i.e., cytochrome P450
    monooxygenases (P450s), esterases, and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs),
    are the focus of this review. A substantial number of the adaptive genomic
    changes associated with insecticide resistance that have been characterized
    to date are transposon mediated. Several lines of evidence suggest that P450
    genes involved in insecticide resistance, and perhaps insecticide
    detoxification genes in general, may share an evolutionary association with
    genes involved in allelochemical metabolism. Differences in the selective
    regime imposed by allelochemicals and insecticides may account for the
    relative importance of regulatory or structural mutations in conferring
    resistance.

    Panicle architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits that
    directly contribute to grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We report
    herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp)
    mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved
    plant architecture. Morphological analyses reveal that panicles of two
    mutants produced more inflorescence branches, especially the primary
    branches, and contained more grains. Moreover, mutant plants also display
    more lodging resistance than the wild type. The grain yield per plant in
    mutants is also increased, suggesting that mutant plants have useful
    potential for high grain yield in rice breeding. Map-based cloning reveals
    that LARGER PANICLE (LP) encodes a Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein.
    RNA in situ hybridization studies display that LP expression was enriched in
    the branch primordial region. Subcellular localization analyses demonstrate
    that LP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, suggesting that
    LP might be involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Using
    yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation
    analysis, we confirm that LP is an F-box protein and could interact with
    rice SKP1-like protein in an F-box domain-dependent manner. Quantitative
    real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin
    oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that
    LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues. These
    results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant
    architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby
    representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production
    plants.

    Global warming threatens many aspects of human life, for example, by
    reducing crop yields. Breeding heat-tolerant crops using genes conferring
    thermotolerance is a fundamental way to help deal with this challenge. Here
    we identify a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for thermotolerance in
    African rice (Oryza glaberrima), Thermo-tolerance 1 (TT1), which encodes an
    α2 subunit of the 26S proteasome involved in the degradation of
    ubiquitinated proteins. Ubiquitylome analysis indicated that OgTT1 protects
    cells from heat stress through more efficient elimination of cytotoxic
    denatured proteins and more effective maintenance of heat-response processes
    than achieved with OsTT1. Variation in TT1 has been selected for on the
    basis of climatic temperature and has had an important role in local
    adaptation during rice evolution. In addition, we found that overexpression
    of OgTT1 was associated with markedly enhanced thermotolerance in rice,
    Arabidopsis and Festuca elata. This discovery may lead to an increase in
    crop security in the face of the ongoing threat of global warming.

    Trichogrammatids are minute parasitoid wasps that develop within other
    insect eggs. They are less than half a millimeter long, smaller than some
    protozoans. The Trichogrammatidae are one of the earliest branching families
    of Chalcidoidea: a diverse superfamily of approximately half a million
    species of parasitoid wasps, proposed to have evolved from a miniaturized
    ancestor. Trichogramma are frequently used in agriculture, released as
    biological control agents against major moth and butterfly pests.
    Additionally, Trichogramma are well known for their symbiotic bacteria that
    induce asexual reproduction in infected females. Knowledge of the genome
    sequence of Trichogramma is a major step towards further understanding its
    biology and potential applications in pest control.

    The Na,K-ATPase is the membrane “pump” that generates the Na+ and K+
    gradients across the plasma membrane that drives many physiological
    processes. This enzyme is highly sensitive to inhibition by cardiotonic
    steroids, most notably the digitalis/ouabain class of compounds, which have
    been used for centuries to treat congestive heart failure and arrhythmias.
    The amino acids that constitute the ouabain-binding site are highly
    conserved across the evolutionary spectrum. This could be fortuitous or
    could result from this site being conserved because it has an important
    biological function. New physiological approaches using genetically
    engineered mice are being used to define the biological significance of the
    “receptor function” of the Na,K-ATPase and its regulation by potential
    endogenous cardiotonic steroid-like compounds. These studies extend the
    reach of earlier studies involving the biochemical purification of
    endogenous regulatory ligands.

    The origin of insect wings is still a highly debated mystery in biology,
    despite the importance of this evolutionary innovation. There are currently
    two prominent, but contrasting wing origin hypotheses (the tergal origin
    hypothesis and the pleural origin hypothesis). Through studies in the
    Tribolium beetle, we have previously obtained functional evidence supporting
    a third hypothesis, the dual origin hypothesis. Although this hypothesis can
    potentially unify the two competing hypotheses, it requires further testing
    from various fields. Here, we investigated the genetic regulation of the
    tissues serially homologous to wings in the abdomen, outside of the
    appendage-bearing segments, in Tribolium. We found that the formation of
    ectopic wings in the abdomen upon homeotic transformation relies not only on
    the previously identified abdominal wing serial homolog (gin-trap), but also
    on a secondary tissue in the pleural location. Using an enhancer trap line
    of nubbin (a wing lineage marker), we were able to visualize both of these
    two tissues (of tergal and pleural nature) contributing to form a complete
    wing. These results support the idea that the presence of two distinct sets
    of wing serial homologs per segment represents an ancestral state of the
    wing serial homologs, and can therefore further support a dual evolutionary
    origin of insect wings. Our analyses also uncovered detailed Hox regulation
    of abdominal wing serial homologs, which can be used as a foundation to
    elucidate the molecular mechanisms that have facilitated the evolution of
    bona fide insect wings, as well as the diversification of other wing serial
    homologs.

    Several mutants derived from transformed human B cell lines are defective in
    expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. The
    failure to express a class II gene in at least one such mutant line has been
    mapped to the MHC class II X box, a conserved transcriptional element in the
    promoter region. A complementary DNA encoding a DNA-binding protein (human X
    box binding protein, hXBP-1) whose target is the human DR alpha X box and
    the 3' flanking region has now been cloned. This complementary DNA encoded a
    protein with structural similarities to the c-jun proto-oncogene product,
    and its target sequence was closely related to the palindromic target
    sequence of c-jun. Mutation of the hXBP-1 DNA target sequence decreased DR
    alpha promoter activity in vivo. These studies suggest that the hXBP-1
    protein acts as a transcription factor in B cells.

    The architecture of the panicle, including grain size and panicle
    morphology, directly determines grain yield. Panicle erectness, which is
    selected for achieving ideal plant architecture in the northern part of
    China, has drawn increasing attention of rice breeders. Here, dense and
    erect panicle 2 (dep2) mutant, which shows a dense and erect panicle
    phenotype, was identified. DEP2 encodes a plant-specific protein without any
    known functional domain. Expression profiling of DEP2 revealed that it is
    highly expressed in young tissues, with most abundance in young panicles.
    Morphological and expression analysis indicated that mutation in DEP2 mainly
    affects the rapid elongation of rachis and primary and secondary branches,
    but does not impair the initiation or formation of panicle primordia.
    Further analysis suggests that decrease of panicle length in dep2 is caused
    by a defect in cell proliferation during the exponential elongation of
    panicle. Despite a more compact plant type in the dep2 mutant, no
    significant alteration in grain production was found between wild type and
    dep2 mutant. Therefore, the study of DEP2 not only strengthens our
    understanding of the molecular genetic basis of panicle architecture but
    also has important implications for rice breeding.

  abstract: >-
    The phytohormone cytokinin (CK) positively regulates the activity and
    function of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which is a major parameter
    determining seed production. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) Gn1a/OsCKX2 (Grain
    number 1a/Cytokinin oxidase 2) gene, which encodes a cytokinin oxidase, has
    been identified as a major quantitative trait locus contributing to grain
    number improvement in rice breeding practice. However, the molecular
    mechanism of how the expression of OsCKX2 is regulated in planta remains
    elusive. Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT
    AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates OsCKX2 expression in the
    reproductive meristem. DST-directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK
    accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the
    reproductive organs. We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of
    the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and
    elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem
    activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain
    number. Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid
    the Gn1a-dependent and Gn1a-independent effects on grain production. Our
    study reveals that, as a unique regulator of reproductive meristem activity,
    DST may be explored to facilitate the genetic enhancement of grain
    production in rice and other small grain cereals.

    MOTIVATION:RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for accurately measuring
    gene expression levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the
    mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or
    transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from
    which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and
    isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods
    either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to
    genes heuristically. RESULTS:We present a generative statistical model and
    associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a
    principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data,
    we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved
    accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a
    statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of
    isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of
    modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method
    indicate that a read length of 20-25 bases is optimal for gene-level
    expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing
    throughput is fixed.

    Production of maternal haploids using a conspecific haploid inducer is
    routine and highly efficient in maize. However, the underlying mechanism of
    haploid induction (HI) is unclear. We develop a method to isolate three
    nuclei from a pollen grain and four microspores from a tetrad for
    whole-genome sequencing. A high rate of aneuploidy is observed at the
    three-nucleus stage (6/22 pollens) rather than at the tetrad stage (1/72
    microspores) in one HI line CAU5. Frequent aneuploidy is also observed in
    another two inducer lines, but not in two regular lines, which implies that
    HI may be associated with pollen aneuploidy. We further sequence the
    individual embryos and endosperms of 88 maize kernels crossing between
    regular and inducer lines. Genome-wide elimination of the CAU5-derived
    chromosome is identified in eight of 81 embryos. Together, these results
    suggest that continuous chromosome fragmentation occurring post meiosis in
    the gametophyte may cause haploidy of the embryo.

    How polyphagous herbivores cope with the diversity and unpredictability of
    plant defenses remains largely unknown at both the genetic and molecular
    levels. To examine whether generalist counterdefense enzymes are
    structurally more flexible and functionally more diverse, two
    counterdefensive allelochemical-metabolizing cytochrome P450 proteins,
    CYP6B1 from the specialist Papilio polyxenes, feeding on
    furanocoumarin-containing plants, and CYP6B8 from the generalist Helicoverpa
    zea, feeding on hundreds of host plant species, are compared structurally
    and functionally. Molecular modeling indicates that CYP6B8 has more flexible
    overall folding, a more elastic catalytic pocket, and one more substrate
    access channel than CYP6B1. Baculovirus-mediated expression of the CYP6B8
    and CYP6B1 proteins demonstrates that CYP6B8 metabolizes six
    biosynthetically diverse plant allelochemicals (xanthotoxin, quercetin,
    flavone, chlorogenic acid, indole-3-carbinol, and rutin) and three
    insecticides (diazinon, cypermethrin, and aldrin), whereas CYP6B1
    metabolizes only two allelochemicals (xanthotoxin and flavone) and one
    insecticide (diazinon) of those tested. These results indicate that
    generalist counterdefense proteins are capable of accepting a more
    structurally diverse array of compounds compared with specialist
    counterdefense proteins.

    Oligoarray analysis was used to determine the number and nature of genes
    expressed in third instar Drosophila melanogaster larval midguts. The
    majority of transcripts were associated with protein synthesis and
    metabolism. Serine proteases were the main proteolytic enzymes detected.
    Some 40% of the cytochrome P450 genes and 74% of the glutathione S
    transferases (GSTs) in the genome of D. melanogaster were observed to be
    expressed in the midgut by oligoarray analysis. We also identified potential
    transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) of P450s, GSTs and
    carboxylesterases. Many of the midgut-expressed GST genes contained
    candidate TFBMs homologous to TFBMs in mammals that have been associated
    with responses to oxidative stress. We also investigated the response of
    GSTs in the midgut to dietary H2O2, which showed a dosage-based differential
    response.

    The spatiotemporal architecture of inflorescences that bear flowers
    determines plant reproductive success by affecting fruit set and plant
    interaction with pollinators. The inflorescence architecture that displays
    great diversity across flowering plants depends on developmental decisions
    at inflorescence meristems. Here we report a key conserved genetic pathway
    determining inflorescence architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza
    sativa (rice). In Arabidopsis, four MADS-box genes, SUPPRESSOR OF
    OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, AGAMOUS-LIKE 24, and
    SEPALLATA 4 act redundantly and directly to suppress TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1)
    in emerging floral meristems. This is indispensable for the well-known
    function of APETALA1 in specifying floral meristems and is coupled with a
    conformational change in chromosome looping at the TFL1 locus. Similarly, we
    demonstrate that the orthologs of these MADS-box genes in rice determine
    panicle branching by regulating TFL1-like genes. Our findings reveal a
    conserved regulatory pathway that determines inflorescence architecture in
    flowering plants.

    Inferring demographic history is an important task in population genetics.
    Many existing inference methods are based on predefined simplified
    population models, which are more suitable for hypothesis testing than
    exploratory analysis. We developed a novel model-flexible method called
    stairway plot, which infers changes in population size over time using SNP
    frequency spectra. This method is applicable for whole-genome sequences of
    hundreds of individuals. Using extensive simulation, we demonstrate the
    usefulness of the method for inferring demographic history, especially
    recent changes in population size. We apply the method to the whole-genome
    sequence data of 9 populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and show a
    pattern of fluctuations in human populations from 10,000 to 200,000 years
    ago.

    The A20/AN1 zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) play pivotal roles in animal immune
    responses and plant stress responses. From previous gibberellin (GA)
    microarray data and A20/AN1 ZFP family member association, we chose Oryza
    sativa dwarf rice with overexpression of gibberellin-induced gene (OsDOG) to
    examine its function in the GA pathway. OsDOG was induced by gibberellic
    acid (GA(3)) and repressed by the GA-synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol.
    Different transgenic lines with constitutive expression of OsDOG showed
    dwarf phenotypes due to deficiency of cell elongation. Additional GA(1) and
    real-time PCR quantitative assay analyses confirmed that the decrease of
    GA(1) in the overexpression lines resulted from reduced expression of GA3ox2
    and enhanced expression of GA2ox1 and GA2ox3. Adding exogenous GA rescued
    the constitutive expression phenotypes of the transgenic lines. OsDOG has a
    novel function in regulating GA homeostasis and in negative maintenance of
    plant cell elongation in rice.

    Inflorescence and spikelet development determine grain yields in cereals.
    Although multiple genes are known to be involved in the regulation of floral
    organogenesis, the underlying molecular network remains unclear in cereals.
    Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) microRNA396d (OsmiR396d) and
    its Os Growth Regulating Factor (OsGRF) targets, together with Os Growth
    Regulating Factor-Interacting Factor1 (OsGIF1), are involved in the
    regulation of floral organ development through the rice JMJD2 family jmjC
    gene 706 (OsJMJ706) and crinkly4 receptor-like kinase (OsCR4). Transgenic
    knockdown lines of OsGRF6, a predicted target of OsmiR396d, and
    overexpression lines of OsmiR396d showed similar defects in floral organ
    development, including open husks, long sterile lemmas, and altered floral
    organ morphology. These defects were almost completely rescued by
    overexpression of OsGRF6. OsGRF6 and its ortholog OsGRF10 were the most
    highly expressed OsGRF family members in young inflorescences, and the
    grf6/grf10 double mutant displayed abnormal florets. OsGRF6/OsGRF10
    localized to the nucleus, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed
    that both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 bind the GA response element in the promoters
    of OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, which were reported to participate in the regulation
    of floral organ development. In addition, OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 could
    transactivate OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, an activity that was enhanced in the
    presence of OsGIF1, which can bind both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10. Together, our
    results suggest that OsmiR396d regulates the expression of OsGRF genes,
    which function with OsGIF1 in floret development through targeting of JMJ706
    and OsCR4. This work thus reveals a microRNA-mediated regulation module for
    controlling spikelet development in rice.

    Rice inflorescence meristem (IM) activity is essential for panicle
    development and grain production. How chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms
    regulate IM activity remains unclear. Genome-wide analysis revealed that in
    addition to genes involved in the vegetative to reproductive transition,
    many metabolic and protein synthetic genes were activated in IM compared
    with shoot apical meristem and that a change in the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio
    was an important factor for the differential expression of many genes.
    Thousands of genes gained or lost H3K27me3 in IM, and downregulation of the
    H3K27 methyltransferase gene SET DOMAIN GROUP 711 (SDG711) or mutation of
    the H3K4 demethylase gene JMJ703 eliminated the increase of H3K27me3 in many
    genes. SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 repressed several important genes involved
    in IM activity and many genes that are silent in the IM but activated during
    floral organogenesis or other developmental stages. SDG711 overexpression
    augmented IM activity and increased panicle size; suppression of SDG711 by
    RNA interference had the opposite effect. Double knockdown/knockout of
    SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size. These results suggest that
    SDG711 and JMJ703 have agonistic functions in reprogramming the
    H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio and modulating gene expression in the IM.

    The two most commonly used methods to analyze data from real-time,
    quantitative PCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative
    quantification. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number,
    usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative
    quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a
    treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The
    2−ΔΔCT method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene
    expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this
    report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the
    2−ΔΔCT method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of
    two variations of the 2−ΔΔCT method that may be useful in the analysis of
    real-time, quantitative PCR data.

  abstract: >-
    According to the Red Queen hypothesis—which states that interactions among
    species (such as hosts and parasites) lead to constant natural selection for
    adaptation and counter-adaptation—the disproportionate evolutionary success
    of parasites on common host genotypes leads to correlated selection for
    sexual reproduction1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and local adaptation by the parasite
    population9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we determined whether local adaptation is
    due to disproportionate infection of common host genotypes, and, if so,
    whether infection of common host genotypes is due to commonness per se, or
    some other aspect of these genotypes. In a reciprocal cross-inoculation
    experiment parasites occupying the same geographical area (sympatric)
    infected locally common host genotypes significantly more often than rare
    host genotypes, whereas parasites occupying separate geographical areas
    (allopatric) showed no such significant difference. A mixed source of
    parasites (containing F1 hybrids) also showed no difference in infection
    between rare and common host genotypes. These results show that local
    adaptation results from parasite tracking of locally common host genotypes,
    and, as such, a necessary condition of the Red Queen hypothesis is met.

  abstract: >-
    MADS-box genes have been shown to play a major role in defining plant
    architecture. Recently, several MADS-box genes have been reported that are
    highly expressed in the ovule. However, only for the Petunia genes FBP7 and
    FBP11 has a function in defining ovule identity been shown. We have isolated
    a rice MADS-box gene named OsMADS13. Expression analysis has shown that this
    gene is highly expressed in developing ovules. In order to facilitate a
    detailed characterization of rice ovule-expressed genes, a comprehensive
    morphological description of ovule development in rice has been performed.
    The predicted amino acid sequence of OsMADS13 shows significant homology
    with ZAG2, a maize MADS-box gene, which is also expressed mainly in the
    ovule. Mapping of the gene in the rice genome showed that it is located on
    chromosome 12, which is syntenic to two maize regions where ZAG2 and its
    paralogous gene ZMM1 have been mapped. Our results suggest that OsMADS13 is
    the ortholog of ZAG2 and ZMM1 and might play a role in rice ovule and seed
    development.

    In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the
    analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for
    evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small
    replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of
    outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a
    method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation
    for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability
    of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the
    strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The
    DESeq2 package is available at

    As classical phase II detoxification enzymes, glutathione S-transferases
    (GSTs) have been implicated in insecticide resistance and may have evolved
    in response to toxins in the niche-defining feeding substrates of Drosophila
    species. We have annotated the GST genes of the 12 Drosophila species with
    recently sequenced genomes and analyzed their molecular evolution. Gene copy
    number variation is attributable mainly to unequal crossing-over events in
    the large delta and epsilon clusters. Within these gene clusters there are
    also GST genes with slowly diverging orthologs. This implies that they have
    their own unique functions or have spatial/temporal expression patterns that
    impose significant selective constraints. Searches for positively selected
    sites within the GSTs identified G171K in GSTD1, a protein that has
    previously been shown to be capable of metabolizing the insecticide DDT. We
    find that the same radical substitution (G171K) in the substrate-binding
    domain has occurred at least three times in the Drosophila radiation.
    Homology-modeling places site 171 distant from the active site but adjacent
    to an alternative DDT-binding site. We propose that the parallel evolution
    observed at this site is an adaptive response to an environmental toxin and
    that sequencing of historical alleles suggests that this toxin was not a
    synthetic insecticide.

    Experimental investigations of eukaryotic enhancers suggest taht multiple
    binding sites and trans-acting regulatory factors are often required for
    wild-type enhancer function. Genetic analysis of the stripe 2 enhancer of
    even-skipped (eve), an important developmental gene in Drosophila, provides
    support for this view. Given the importance of even-skipped expression in
    early Drosophila development, it might be predicted that many structural
    features of the stripe 2 enhancer will be evolutionarily conserved,
    including the DNA sequences of protein binding sites and the spacing between
    them.To test this hypothesis, we compared sequences of the stripe 2 enhancer
    between four species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. erecta
    and D. pseudoobscura. Our analysis revealed a large number of nucleotide
    substitutions in regulatory protein binding sites for bicoid, hunchback,
    Kruppel and giant, as well as a systematic change in the size of the
    enhancer. Some of the binding sites in D. melanogaster are either absent or
    modified in other species. One functionally important bicoid-binding site in
    D. melanogaster appears to be recently evolved.We, therefore, investigated
    possible functional consequences of sequence differences among these stripe
    2 enhancers by P-element-mediated transformation. This analysis revealed
    that the eve stripe 2 enhancer from each of the four species drove reporter
    gene expression at the identical time and location in D. melanogaster
    embryos. Double staining of native eve protein and transgene mRNA in early
    embryos showed that the reporter gene mimicked native eve expression and, in
    every case, produced sharply defined stripes at the blastoderm stage that
    were coincident with eve stripe 2 protein.We argue that stripe 2 eve
    expression in Drosophila evolution can be viewed as being under constant
    stabilizing selection with respect to the location of the anterior and
    posterior borders of the stripe. We further hypothesize that the stripe 2
    enhancer is functionally robust, so that its evolution may be governed by
    the fixation of both slightly deleterious and adaptive mutations in
    regulatory protein binding sites as well as in the spacing between binding
    sites. This view allows for a slow but continual turnover of functionally
    important changes in the stripe 2 enhancer.

    Ideal plant architecture1 (IPA1) is critical in regulating rice (Oryza
    sativa) plant architecture and substantially enhances grain yield. To
    elucidate its molecular basis, we first confirmed IPA1 as a functional
    transcription activator and then identified 1067 and 2185 genes associated
    with IPA1 binding sites in shoot apices and young panicles, respectively,
    through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays. The Squamosa
    promoter binding protein-box direct binding core motif GTAC was highly
    enriched in IPA1 binding peaks; interestingly, a previously uncharacterized
    indirect binding motif TGGGCC/T was found to be significantly enriched
    through the interaction of IPA1 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen
    promoter binding factor1 or promoter binding factor2. Genome-wide expression
    profiling by RNA sequencing revealed IPA1 roles in diverse pathways.
    Moreover, our results demonstrated that IPA1 could directly bind to the
    promoter of rice teosinte branched1, a negative regulator of tiller bud
    outgrowth, to suppress rice tillering, and directly and positively regulate
    dense and erect panicle1, an important gene regulating panicle architecture,
    to influence plant height and panicle length. The elucidation of target
    genes of IPA1 genome-wide will contribute to understanding the molecular
    mechanisms underlying plant architecture and to facilitating the breeding of
    elite varieties with ideal plant architecture.

    A gene-trap system is established for Drosophila. Unlike the conventional
    enhancer-trap system, the gene-trap system allows the recovery only of fly
    lines whose genes are inactivated by a P-element insertion, i.e., mutants.
    In the gene-trap system, the reporter gene expression reflects precisely the
    spatial and temporal expression pattern of the trapped gene. Flies in which
    gene trap occurred are identified by a two-step screening process using two
    independent markers, mini-w and Gal4, each indicating the integration of the
    vector downstream of the promoter of a gene (dual tagging), mini-w has its
    own promoter but lacks a polyadenylation signal. Therefore, mini-w mRNA is
    transcribed from its own promoter regardless of the vector integration site
    in the genome. However, the eyes of flies are not orange or red unless the
    vector is incorporated into a gene enabling mini-w to be spliced to a
    downstream exon of the host gene and polyadenylated at the 3' end. The
    promoter-less Gal4 reporter is expressed as a fusion mRNA only when it is
    integrated downstream of the promoter of a host gene. The exons of trapped
    genes can be readily cloned by vectorette RT-PCR, followed by RACE and PCR
    using cDNA libraries. Thus, the dual-tagging gene-trap system provides a
    means for (i) efficient mutagenesis, (ii) unequivocal identification of
    genes responsible for mutant phenotypes, (iii) precise detection of
    expression patterns of trapped genes, and (iv) rapid cloning of trapped
    genes.

  abstract: >-
    Many insects have evolved resistance to abamectin but the mechanisms
    involved in this resistance have not been well characterized. P-glycoprotein
    (P-gp), an ATP-dependent drug-efflux pump transmembrane protein, may be
    involved in abamectin resistance. We investigated the role of P-gp in
    abamectin (ABM) resistance in Drosophila using an ABM-resistant strain
    developed in the laboratory. A toxicity assay, Western blotting analysis and
    a vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity assay all demonstrated the existence of
    a direct relationship between P-gp expression and ABM resistance in these
    flies. Our observations indicate that P-gp levels in flies' heads were
    higher than in their thorax and abdomen, and that both P-gp levels and
    LC(50) values were higher in resistant than in susceptible and
    P-gp-deficient strains. In addition, P-gp levels in the blood-brain barrier
    (BBB) of resistant flies were higher than in susceptible and P-gp-deficient
    flies, which is further evidence that a high level of P-gp in the BBB is
    related to ABM resistance. Furthermore, we found greater expression of
    Drosophila EGFR (dEGFR) in the resistant strain than in the susceptible
    strain, and that the level of Drosophila Akt (dAkt) was much higher in
    resistant than in susceptible flies, whereas that in P-gp-deficient flies
    was very low. Compared to susceptible flies, P-gp levels in the resistant
    strain were markedly suppressed by the dEGFR and dAkt inhibitors lapatinib
    and wortmannin. These results suggest that the increased P-gp in resistant
    flies was regulated by the dEGFR and dAkt pathways and that increased
    expression of P-gp is an important component of ABM resistance in insects.

  abstract: >-
    Avermectin (AVM) is a macrocyclic lactone agent widely used as a nematicide,
    acaricide and insecticide in veterinary medicine and plant protection.
    P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic
    compounds, and is involved in multidrug resistance. To understand the
    development of AVM resistance in invertebrates, we investigated the
    mechanisms by which AVM affected P-gp expression in Drosophila S2 cells. We
    found that AVM induced upregulation of P-gp protein expression, increased
    P-gp ATPase activity and enhanced cellular efflux of the P-gp substrate
    rhodamine 123 from cells. Furthermore, we observed that AVM-induced
    expression of P-gp was due to elevation of intracellular calcium
    concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). This occurred both directly, by activating
    calcium ion channels, and indirectly, by activating chloride ion channels.
    These results are supported by our observations that verapamil, a Ca(2+)
    channel blocker, and niflumic acid, a chloride channel antagonist,
    significantly attenuated AVM-induced [Ca(2+)](i) elevation, thereby reducing
    P-gp expression. Inhibition of P-gp with anti-P-gp antibody or cyclosporine
    A (a P-gp inhibitor) reduced the AVM-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)](i),
    implying that P-gp and [Ca(2+)](i) regulate each other. Finally, we found
    that trifluoperazine, a calmodulin inhibitor, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic
    acid, an NF-κB inhibitor, attenuated the AVM-induced expression of P-gp,
    suggesting that AVM induces P-gp protein expression via the
    calmodulin/Relish (NF-κB) signaling pathway.

    BACKGROUND:Gene set analysis (GSA) is a widely used strategy for gene
    expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of
    related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene
    analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological
    relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage as they cannot
    handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs.
    RESULTS:To address these limitations, we present a new GSA method called
    Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully apply GAGE
    to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental
    designs and profiling techniques. GAGE shows significantly better results
    when compared to two other commonly used GSA methods of GSEA and PAGE. We
    demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency
    across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3)
    biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred.GAGE reveals
    novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously
    unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data sets,
    GAGE derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying
    lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP6
    study, GAGE predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP6 induced
    osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF beta signaling,
    JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways-all of
    which are supported by the experimental literature. CONCLUSION:GAGE is
    generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes
    and experimental designs. GAGE consistently outperformed two most frequently
    used GSA methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant
    regulatory pathways. The GAGE method is implemented in R in the "gage"
    package, available under the GNU GPL from
    http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/\textasciitildeluow/downloads.php.

    Sugar conjugation is a major pathway for the inactivation and excretion of
    both endogenous and exogenous compounds. We report here the molecular
    cloning and functional characterization of a phenol UDP-glucosyltransferase
    (UGT) from the silkworm. Bombyx mori. which was named BmUGT1. The complete
    cDNA clone is 1.6 kb. and the gene is expressed in several tissues of
    fifth-instar larvae, including fat body, midgut, integument, testis. silk
    gland and haemocytes. The predicted protein comprises 520 amino acids and
    has approximate to 30% overall amino-acid identity with other members of the
    UGT family. The most conserved region of the protein is the C-terminal half,
    which has been implicated in binding the UDP-sugar. BmUGT1 was expressed in
    insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, and a range of
    compounds belonging to diverse chemical groups were assessed as potential
    substrates for the enzyme. The expressed enzyme had a wide substrate
    specificity, showing activity with flavonoids, coumarins, terpenoids and
    simple phenols. These results support a role for the enzyme in detoxication
    processes, such as minimizing the harmful effects of ingested plant
    allelochemicals. This work represents the first instance where an insect ugt
    gene has been associated with a specific enzyme activity.

    Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial grass that has been
    designated as an herbaceous model biofuel crop for the United States of
    America. To facilitate accelerated breeding programs of switchgrass, we
    developed both an association panel and linkage populations for genome-wide
    association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS). All of the 840
    individuals were then genotyped using genotyping by sequencing (GBS),
    generating 350 GB of sequence in total. As a highly heterozygous polyploid
    (tetraploid and octoploid) species lacking a reference genome, switchgrass
    is highly intractable with earlier methodologies of single nucleotide
    polymorphism (SNP) discovery. To access the genetic diversity of species
    like switchgrass, we developed a SNP discovery pipeline based on a network
    approach called the Universal Network-Enabled Analysis Kit (UNEAK).
    Complexities that hinder single nucleotide polymorphism discovery, such as
    repeats, paralogs, and sequencing errors, are easily resolved with UNEAK.
    Here, 1.2 million putative SNPs were discovered in a diverse collection of
    primarily upland, northern-adapted switchgrass populations. Further analysis
    of this data set revealed the fundamentally diploid nature of tetraploid
    switchgrass. Taking advantage of the high conservation of genome structure
    between switchgrass and foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), two
    parent-specific, synteny-based, ultra high-density linkage maps containing a
    total of 88,217 SNPs were constructed. Also, our results showed clear
    patterns of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-ploidy in natural
    populations of switchgrass. Phylogenetic analysis supported a general
    south-to-north migration path of switchgrass. In addition, this analysis
    suggested that upland tetraploid arose from upland octoploid. All together,
    this study provides unparalleled insights into the diversity, genomic
    complexity, population structure, phylogeny, phylogeography, ploidy, and
    evolutionary dynamics of switchgrass.

    We describe an in vivo model for investigation of detoxification mechanisms
    of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, important for the development of malaria
    control programmes. Cytochrome P450s are involved in metabolic insecticide
    resistance and require NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) to function.
    Here we demonstrate that the major sites of adult mosquito CPR expression
    are oenocytes, mid-gut epithelia and head appendages. High CPR expression
    was also evident in Drosophila oenocytes indicating a general functional
    role in these insect cells. RNAi mediated knockdown drastically reduced CPR
    expression in oenocytes, and to a lesser extent in mid-gut epithelia; the
    head was unaffected. These flies showed enhanced sensitivity to permethrin,
    demonstrating a key role for abdominal/mid-gut P450s in pyrethroid
    metabolism, aiding the development of insecticides.

    Gene duplication has generally been viewed as a necessary source of material
    for the origin of evolutionary novelties, but it is unclear how often gene
    duplicates arise and how frequently they evolve new functions. Observations
    from the genomic databases for several eukaryotic species suggest that
    duplicate genes arise at a very high rate, on average 0.01 per gene per
    million years. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed
    selection early in their history, with a moderate fraction of them evolving
    in an effectively neutral manner during this period. However, the vast
    majority of gene duplicates are silenced within a few million years, with
    the few survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection.
    Although duplicate genes may only rarely evolve new functions, the
    stochastic silencing of such genes may play a significant role in the
    passive origin of new species.

    Complete genomic sequences from diverse phylogenetic lineages reveal notable
    increases in genome complexity from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes.
    The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the
    retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of
    spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of
    these modi. cations emerged passively in response to the long-term
    population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size.
    According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was
    initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel
    substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural
    selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes
    may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and
    morphologies.

    InterMine is a data integration warehouse and analysis software system
    developed for large and complex biological data sets. Designed for
    integrative analysis, it can be accessed through a user-friendly web
    interface. For bioinformaticians, extensive web services as well as
    programming interfaces for most common scripting languages support access to
    all features. The web interface includes a useful identifier look-up system,
    and both simple and sophisticated search options. Interactive results tables
    enable exploration, and data can be filtered, summarized, and browsed. A set
    of graphical analysis tools provide a rich environment for data exploration
    including statistical enrichment of sets of genes or other entities.
    InterMine databases have been developed for the major model organisms,
    budding yeast, nematode worm, fruit fly, zebrafish, mouse, and rat together
    with a newly developed human database. Here, we describe how this has
    facilitated interoperation and development of cross-organism analysis tools
    and reports. InterMine as a data exploration and analysis tool is also
    described. All the InterMine-based systems described in this article are
    resources freely available to the scientific community.

  abstract: >-
    The transition to flowering is a major determinant of plant architecture,
    and variation in the timing of flowering can have profound effects on
    inflorescence architecture, flower production and yield. Here, we show that
    the tomato mutant terminating flower (tmf) flowers early and converts the
    multiflowered inflorescence into a solitary flower as a result of precocious
    activation of a conserved floral specification complex encoded by ANANTHA
    (AN) and FALSIFLORA (FA). Without TMF, the coordinated flowering process is
    disrupted, causing floral identity genes, such as AN and members of the
    SEPALLATA (SEP) family, to activate precociously, while the expression of
    flowering transition genes, such as FRUITFULL (FUL), is delayed. Indeed,
    driving AN expression precociously is sufficient to cause early flowering,
    and this expression transforms multiflowered inflorescences into normal
    solitary flowers resembling those of the Solanaceae species petunia and
    tobacco. Thus, by timing AN activation, TMF synchronizes flower formation
    with the gradual reproductive transition, which, in turn, has a key role in
    determining simple versus complex inflorescences.

    A major challenge of biology is understanding the relationship between
    molecular genetic variation and variation in quantitative traits, including
    fitness. This relationship determines our ability to predict phenotypes from
    genotypes and to understand how evolutionary forces shape variation within
    and between species. Previous efforts to dissect the genotype–phenotype map
    were based on incomplete genotypic information. Here, we describe the
    Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a community resource
    for analysis of population genomics and quantitative traits. The DGRP
    consists of fully sequenced inbred lines derived from a natural population.
    Population genomic analyses reveal reduced polymorphism in centromeric
    autosomal regions and the X chromosome, evidence for positive and negative
    selection, and rapid evolution of the X chromosome. Many variants in novel
    genes, most at low frequency, are associated with quantitative traits and
    explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance. The DGRP facilitates
    genotype–phenotype mapping using the power of Drosophila genetics.

  abstract: "Summary\nCells, the basic units of biological structure and function, vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual\_cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular\_atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq\_will accelerate biological discovery by enabling\_routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.\nVideo Abstract"

  abstract: >-
    Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that
    preferentially targets the developing nervous system. Variable outcomes of
    prenatal MeHg exposure within a population point to a genetic component that
    regulates MeHg toxicity. We therefore sought to identify fundamental MeHg
    tolerance genes using the Drosophila model for genetic and molecular
    dissection of a MeHg tolerance trait. We observe autosomal dominance in a
    MeHg tolerance trait (development on MeHg food) in both wild-derived and
    laboratory-selected MeHg-tolerant strains of flies. We performed
    whole-genome transcript profiling of larval brains of tolerant (laboratory
    selected) and nontolerant (control) strains in the presence and absence of
    MeHg stress. Pairwise transcriptome comparisons of four conditions
    (+/-selection and +/-MeHg) identified a "down-down-up" expression signature,
    whereby MeHg alone and selection alone resulted in a greater number of
    downregulated transcripts, and the combination of selection + MeHg resulted
    in a greater number of upregulated transcripts. Functional annotation
    cluster analyses showed enrichment for monooxygenases/oxidoreductases, which
    include cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members. Among the 10 CYPs upregulated
    with selection + MeHg in tolerant strains, CYP6g1, previously identified as
    the dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane resistance allele in flies, was the
    most highly expressed and responsive to MeHg. Among all the genes, Turandot
    A (TotA), an immune pathway regulated humoral response gene, showed the
    greatest upregulation with selection + MeHg. Neural-specific transgenic
    overexpression of TotA enhanced MeHg tolerance during pupal development.
    Identification of TotA and CYP genes as MeHg tolerance genes is an inroad to
    investigating the conserved function of immune signaling and phase I
    metabolism pathways in MeHg toxicity and tolerance in higher organisms.

  abstract: >-
    The involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in olfaction has been
    demonstrated in vertebrates over the past decade. In insects, these enzymes
    are well known for their role in biosynthesis of endogenous compounds as
    well as xenobiotic metabolism, but the presence of olfactory cytochrome
    P450s was poorly investigated. Using a PCR-based strategy, we have isolated
    cDNAs of two new microsomal P450s from the antennae of the cabbage armyworm
    Mamestra brassicae, CYP9A13 and CYP4G20 of two new microsomal P450s, as well
    as their red-ox partner, the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Their
    distribution through the body and their cellular localization within the
    antennae were studied by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. The three genes
    are strongly expressed in some sensory units of the antennae, the sensilla
    trichodea, which are tuned to odorants detection. The putative functions of
    the corresponding enzymes are discussed in regard to their respective
    expression patterns and to our knowledge on olfactory P450 metabolism in
    mammals. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract: >-
    Previous biochemical evidence suggests that a cytochrome P450 specific to
    male antennae of the pale-brown chafer, Phyllopertha diversa, has evolved as
    a pheromone-degrading enzyme. By using a bioinformatics; approach, we have
    now cloned three P450 cDNAs: CYP4AW1, CYP4AW2, and CYP6AT1. RT-PCR indicated
    that CYP4AW2 is expressed in all tissues examined, that CYP6AT1 is
    antennae-rich, and that CYP4AW1 is antennae-specific. Both tissue
    specificity and electrophysiological studies strongly support that CYP4AW1
    in A diversa is a pheromone-degrading enzyme involved in pheromone
    inactivation. Highly sensitive, pheromone-specific olfactory receptor
    neurons in male antennae were completely desensitized by direct application
    of metyrapone into the sensillar lymph. When tested in the same or different
    individuals, the metyrapone treatment had no effect on olfactory receptor
    neurons tuned to the plant volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which might be
    inactivated by an esterase. Metyrapone treatment did not affect pheromone
    reception in the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica, in the scarab beetle,
    Anomala octiescostata, or in the Oriental beetle, Exomala orientalis.
    Metyrapone-induced anosmia was restricted to the pheromone detectors in A
    diversa, which became insensitive to physiological concentrations of
    pheromones for a few minutes. As opposed to previous trials, the specificity
    of the inhibitor and pheromone system led to unambiguous evidence for the
    role of pheromone-degrading enzymes in the fast inactivation of pheromones.

  abstract: >-
    The heme oxygenase (HO) system consists of two forms identified to date: the
    oxidative stress-inducible protein HO-1 (HSP32) and the constitutive isozyme
    HO-2. These proteins, which are different gene products, have little in
    common in primary structure, regulation, or tissue distribution. Both,
    however, catalyze oxidation of heme to biologically active molecules: iron,
    a gene regulator; biliverdin, an antioxidant; and carbon monoxide, a heme
    ligand. Finding the impressive heme-degrading activity of brain led to the
    suggestion that ”HO in brain has functions aside from heme degradation” and
    to subsequent exploration of carbon monoxide as a promising and potentially
    significant messenger molecule. There is much parallelism between the
    biological actions and functions of the CO- and NO-generating systems; and
    their regulation is intimately (inked. This review highlights the current
    information on molecular and biochemical properties of HO-1 and HO-2 and
    addresses the possible mechanisms for mutual regulatory interactions between
    the CO- and NO-generating systems.

    The expression of two second chromosome-linked cytochrome P450 genes, Cyp6a2
    and Cyp6a8, of Drosophila melanogaster was measured in various strains. Six
    different strains, including ry(506) and 91-C, showed low or undetectable
    levels of CYP6A2 and CYP6A8 mRNAs, suggesting that low expression is the
    wild-type phenotype of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes. In the 91-R and MHIII-D23
    strains, however, both these genes are overexpressed. In order to examine
    the genetic basis of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 expression, CYP6A2 and CYP6A8 RNA
    levels were measured in the Fl hybrids of overproducer (91-R and MHIII-D23)
    and underproducer (rq(506) and 91-C) strains. Results showed that the total
    amounts of CYP6A2 and CYP6A8 mRNAs in the Fl hybrids were lower than half
    the amounts of these RNAs found in the overproducer parental strains. This
    suggested that the underproducer strains carry loci which downregulate
    Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 gene expression. To determine the chromosome linkage of
    these loci, several stocks homozygous for the second chromosome of
    overproducer 91-R strain and, therefore, homozygous for the Cyp6a2-91R and
    Cyp6a8-91R alleles were synthesized. The third chromosomes in all these
    stocks were from the underproducer ry(506) strain. The levels of expression
    of both Cyp6a2-91R and Cyp6a8-91R genes in these three stocks were
    significantly lower than that observed in the 91-R strain. One of these
    stocks, named iso-2, showing reduced expression, was used to synthesize two
    new isogenic stocks by resubstituting the third chromosome of ry(506) origin
    with third chromosomes of the 91-R strain. Expression of both Cyp6a2-91R and
    Cyp6a8-91R alleles was found to be much higher in these two resubstituted
    isogenic stocks than in the progenitor iso-2 stock. Taken together, these
    results suggest that the second chromosome-linked Cyp6a2 and Cypa8 genes are
    regulated by loci present on the third chromosome, and the wild-type
    function of these loci is to repress these two Cyp genes. The data also
    suggest that Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 overexpression in the 91-R and MHIII-D23
    strains is more likely due to mutation in the repressor locus (or loci)
    rather than in the cis-regulatory sequences of the Cyp6a-2 and Cypda8 genes.

  abstract: >-
    The level of expression of the Cyp6a2 gene is much higher in the
    DDT-resistant 91-R strain than in the susceptible 91-C strain of Drosophila
    melanogaster (Waters et al. (1992b) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89,
    4855-4859). To understand the role of Cyp6a2 and related genes in
    insecticide resistance, we have isolated and characterized two new Cyp6
    genes from the 91-R strain. The polypeptides encoded by these two genes,
    Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9, show 77 and 75% amino acid sequence similarity, and 60
    and 55% identity with Cyp6a2 of D. melanogaster, respectively. In the
    genome, Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9 genes are closely clustered within 4 kb and map at
    region 51C of the second chromosome. In between them another Cyp gene is
    present which is more related to Cyp6a9 than to Cyp6a8. The Cyp6a8 gene
    which is transcriptionally highly active in 91-R, moderately active in
    ry(506) and silent in the 91-C strain hybridizes with 2.0- and 1.8-kb RNAs.
    Two different-sized RNAs, 2.1 and 1.8 kb, also hybridize with the Cyp6a9
    and/or Cyp6a9-related genes. While the level of 2.1-kb RNA is similar in all
    three strains, the level of 1.8-kb RNA is highest in the 91-R strain and
    barely detectable in 91-C strain. Transgenic experiments showed that a
    8.3-kb BamHI fragment contains the cis-regulatory elements for the
    expression of both Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9-related genes. Barbital induces all
    these genes in all three strains and increases the levels of the two Cyp6a8
    transcripts and the 1.8-kb RNA produced by the Cyp6a9 and/or Cyp6a9-related
    genes. Expression of the Cyp6a8 gene is down-regulated in the hybrids of
    91-R and 91-C strains despite the fact that the hybrids carry one copy of
    the highly active allele of the Cyp6a8 gene of the 91-R strain. Based on
    these results we propose that the Cyp6a8 gene in 91-C strain may be turned
    off by an active repressor which might be inhibited by barbital treatment.
    In the 91-R strain, the putative repressor may be defective, allowing high
    level of constitutive expression of the Cyp6a8 gene.

  abstract: >-
    Animal color patterns can affect fitness in the wild; however, little is
    known about the mechanisms that control their formation and subsequent
    evolution. We took advantage of two locally camouflaged populations of
    Peromyscus mice to show that the negative regulator of adult pigmentation,
    Agouti, also plays a key developmental role in color pattern evolution.
    Genetic and functional analyses showed that ventral-specific embryonic
    expression of Agouti establishes a prepattern by delaying the terminal
    differentiation of ventral melanocytes. Moreover, a skin-specific increase
    in both the level and spatial domain of Agouti expression prevents
    melanocyte maturation in a regionalized manner, resulting in a novel and
    adaptive color pattern. Thus, natural selection favors late-acting,
    tissue-specific changes in embryonic Agouti expression to produce large
    changes in adult color pattern.

  abstract: >-
    The bi-enzymatic system of cytochrome P450 (CYP, a hemoprotein) and
    cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR, a diflavoenzyme) mediate the redox
    metabolism of diverse indigenous and xenobiotic molecules in various
    cellular and organ systems, using oxygen and NADPH. Curiously, when a 1: 1
    ratio is seen to be optimal for metabolism, the ubiquitous CYP: CPR
    distribution ratio is 10 to 100: 1 or higher. Further, the NADPH equivalents
    consumed in these in vitro or in situ assemblies usually far exceeded the
    amount of substrate metabolized. We aimed to find the rationale to explain
    for these two oddities. We report here that CPR is capable of activating
    molecular oxygen on its own merit, generating diffusible reduced oxygen
    species (DROS). Also, in the first instance for a flavoprotein, CPR is shown
    to deplete peroxide via diffusible radical mediated process, thereby leading
    to the formation of water (but without significant evolution of oxygen). We
    also quantitatively demonstrate that the rate of oxygen activation and
    peroxide depletion by CPR accounts for the major reactivity in the CYP+CPR
    mixture. We show unambiguously that CPR is able to regulate the
    concentration of diffusible reduced oxygen species in the reaction milieu.
    These findings point out that CPR mediated processes are bound to be
    energetically 'wasteful' and potentially 'hazardous' owing to the
    unavoidable nature of the CPR to generate and deplete DROS. Hence, we can
    understand that CPR is distributed at low densities in cells. Some of the
    activities that were primarily attributed to the heme-center of CYP are now
    established to be a facet of the flavins of CPR. The current approach of
    modeling drugs to minimize "uncoupling" on the basis of erstwhile hypothesis
    stands questionable, considering the ideas brought forth in this work.

    During very early stages of flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana, a
    series of key decisions are taken. Indeed, the position and the basic
    patterning of new flowers are determined in less than 4 days. Given that the
    scientific literature provides hard evidence for the function of only 10% of
    A. thaliana genes, we hypothesized that although many essential genes have
    already been identified, many poorly characterized genes are likely to be
    involved in floral patterning. In the current study, we use high-throughput
    sequencing to describe the transcriptome of the native inflorescence
    meristem, the floral meristem and the new flower immediately after the start
    of organ differentiation. We provide evidence that our experimental system
    is reliable and less affected by experimental artefacts than a widely used
    floral induction system. Furthermore, we show how these data can be used to
    identify candidate genes for functional studies, and to generate hypotheses
    of functional redundancies and regulatory interactions.

  abstract: >-
    Although Apis mellifera, the western honey bee, has long encountered
    pesticides when foraging in agricultural fields, for two decades it has
    encountered pesticides in-hive in the form of acaricides to control Varroa
    destructor, a devastating parasitic mite. The pyrethroid tau-fluvalinate and
    the organophosphate coumaphos have been used for Varroa control, with little
    knowledge of honey bee detoxification mechanisms. Cytochrome P450-mediated
    detoxification contributes to pyrethroid tolerance in many insects, but
    specific P450s responsible for pesticide detoxification in honey bees
    (indeed, in any hymenopteran pollinator) have not been defined. We expressed
    and assayed CYP3 clan midgut P450s and demonstrated that CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and
    CYP9Q3 metabolize tau-fluvalinate to a form suitable for further cleavage by
    the carboxylesterases that also contribute to tau-fluvalinate tolerance.
    These in vitro assays indicated that all of the three CYP9Q enzymes also
    detoxify coumaphos. Molecular models demonstrate that coumaphos and
    tau-fluvalinate fit into the same catalytic pocket, providing a possible
    explanation for the synergism observed between these two compounds.
    Induction of CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 transcripts by honey extracts suggested that
    diet-derived phytochemicals may be natural substrates and heterologous
    expression of CYP9Q3 confirmed activity against quercetin, a flavonoid
    ubiquitous in honey. Up-regulation by honey constituents suggests that diet
    may influence the ability of honey bees to detoxify pesticides. Quantitative
    RT-PCR assays demonstrated that tau-fluvalinate enhances CYP9Q3 transcripts,
    whereas the pyrethroid bifenthrin enhances CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q2 transcripts and
    represses CYP9Q3 transcripts. The independent regulation of these P450s can
    be useful for monitoring and differentiating between pesticide exposures
    in-hive and in agricultural fields.

  abstract: >-
    The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it
    are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the
    last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many
    types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads
    to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same
    genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it
    difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets
    that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially
    improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by
    changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a
    48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel
    processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input
    size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any
    biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these
    enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle
    alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the
    human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two
    species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements
    described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to
    reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the
    dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called
    from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements
    make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.

    Two genes coding for enzymes previously reported to be involved in the final
    steps of juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis in different insect species,
    were characterised in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Juvenile
    hormone acid O-methyltransferase (JHAMT) was previously described to
    catalyse the conversion of farnesoic acid (FA) and JH acid to their methyl
    esters, methyl farnesoate (MF) and JH respectively. A second gene, CYP15A1
    was reported to encode a cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for the
    epoxidation of MF to JH. Additionally, a third gene, FAMeT (originally
    reported to encode a farnesoic acid methyltransferase) was included in this
    study. Using q-RT-PCR, all three genes (JHAMT, CYP15A1 and FAMeT) were found
    to be primarily expressed in the CA of the desert locust, the main
    biosynthetic tissue of JH. An RNA interference approach was used to verify
    the orthologous function of these genes in S. gregaria. Knockdown of the
    three genes in adult animals followed by the radiochemical assay (RCA) for
    JH biosynthesis and release showed that SgJHAMT and SgCYP15A1 are
    responsible for synthesis of MF and JH respectively. Our experiments did not
    show any involvement of SgFAMeT in JH biosynthesis in the desert locust.
    Effective and selective inhibitors of SgJHAMT and SgCYP15A1 would likely
    represent selective biorational locust control agents.

    The Drosophila midgut is maintained throughout its length by superficially
    similar, multipotent intestinal stem cells that generate new enterocytes and
    enteroendocrine cells in response to tissue requirements. We found that the
    midgut shows striking regional differentiation along its anterior-posterior
    axis. At least ten distinct subregions differ in cell morphology, physiology
    and the expression of hundreds of genes with likely tissue functions. Stem
    cells also vary regionally in behavior and gene expression, suggesting that
    they contribute to midgut sub-specialization. Clonal analyses showed that
    stem cells generate progeny located outside their own subregion at only one
    of six borders tested, suggesting that midgut subregions resemble cellular
    compartments involved in tissue development. Tumors generated by disrupting
    Notch signaling arose preferentially in three subregions and tumor cells
    also appeared to respect regional borders. Thus, apparently similar
    intestinal stem cells differ regionally in cell production, gene expression
    and in the ability to spawn tumors.

  abstract: >-
    Steroid hormones regulate many physiological processes in vertebrates,
    nematodes, and arthropods through binding to nuclear receptors (NR), a
    metazoan-specific family of ligand-activated transcription factors. The main
    steps controlling the diversification of this family are now
    well-understood. In contrast, the origin and evolution of steroid ligands
    remain mysterious, although this is crucial for understanding the emergence
    of modern endocrine systems. Using a comparative genomic approach, we
    analyzed complete metazoan genomes to provide a comprehensive view of the
    evolution of major enzymatic players implicated in steroidogenesis at the
    whole metazoan scale. Our analysis reveals that steroidogenesis has been
    independently elaborated in the 3 main bilaterian lineages, and that
    steroidogenic cytochrome P450 enzymes descended from those that detoxify
    xenobiotics.

    Over the course of the past century, flies in the family Drosophilidae have
    been important models for understanding genetic, developmental, cellular,
    ecological, and evolutionary processes. Full genome sequences from a total
    of 12 species promise to extend this work by facilitating comparative
    studies of gene expression, of molecules such as proteins, of developmental
    mechanisms, and of ecological adaptation. Here we review basic biological
    and ecological information of the species whose genomes have recently been
    completely sequenced in the context of current research.

    <h2>Summary</h2><p>Crustaceans possess a diverse array of specialized limbs.
    Although shifts in Hox gene expression domains have been postulated to play
    a role in generating this limb diversity, little functional data have been
    provided to understand the precise roles of Hox genes during crustacean
    development. We used a combination of CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis and
    RNAi knockdown to decipher the function of the six Hox genes expressed in
    the developing mouth and trunk of the amphipod *Parhyale hawaiensis*. These
    experimentally manipulated animals display specific and striking homeotic
    transformations. We found that *abdominal-A* (*abd-A*) and *Abdominal-B*
    (*Abd-B*) are required for proper posterior patterning, with knockout of
    *Abd-B* resulting in an animal with thoracic type legs along what would have
    been an abdomen, and *abd-A* disruption generating a simplified body plan
    characterized by a loss of specialization in both abdominal and thoracic
    appendages. In the thorax, *Ubx* is necessary for gill development and for
    repression of gnathal fate, and *Antp* dictates claw morphology. In the
    mouth, *Scr* and *Antp* confer the part-gnathal, part-thoracic hybrid
    identity of the maxilliped, and *Scr* and *Dfd* prevent antennal identity in
    posterior head segments. Our results allow us to define the role Hox genes
    play in specifying each appendage type in *Parhyale*, including the modular
    nature by which some appendages are patterned by Hox gene inputs. In
    addition, we define how changes in Hox gene expression have generated
    morphological differences between crustacean species. Finally, we also
    highlight the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic mutagenesis in emerging
    model organisms.</p>

  abstract: >-
    When small RNA is sequenced on current sequencing machines, the resulting
    reads are usually longer than the RNA and therefore contain parts of the 3'
    adapter. That adapter must be found and removed error-tolerantly from each
    read before read mapping. Previous solutions are either hard to use or do
    not offer required features, in particular support for color space data. As
    an easy to use alternative, we developed the command-line tool cutadapt,
    which supports 454, Illumina and SOLiD (color space) data, offers two
    adapter trimming algorithms, and has other useful features. Cutadapt,

    Transcriptomics studies often rely on partial reference transcriptomes that
    fail to capture the full catalogue of transcripts and their variations.
    Recent advances in sequencing technologies and assembly algorithms have
    facilitated the reconstruction of the entire transcriptome by deep RNA
    sequencing (RNA-seq), even without a reference genome. However,
    transcriptome assembly from billions of RNA-seq reads, which are often very
    short, poses a significant informatics challenge. This Review summarizes the
    recent developments in transcriptome assembly approaches - reference-based,
    de novo and combined strategies - along with some perspectives on
    transcriptome assembly in the near future.

  abstract: >-
    The classic model for the evolution of novel gene function is through gene
    duplication followed by evolution of a new function by one of the copies
    (neofunctionalization) [ 1, 2 ]. However, other modes have also been found,
    such as novel genes arising from non-coding DNA, chimeric fusions, and
    lateral gene transfers from other organisms [ 3–7 ]. Here we use the rapid
    turnover of venom genes in parasitoid wasps to study how new gene functions
    evolve. In contrast to the classic gene duplication model, we find that a
    common mode of acquisition of new venom genes in parasitoid wasps is
    co-option of single-copy genes from non-venom progenitors. Transcriptome and
    proteome sequencing reveal that recruitment and loss of venom genes occur
    primarily by rapid cis-regulatory expression evolution in the venom gland.
    Loss of venom genes is primarily due to downregulation of expression in the
    gland rather than gene death through coding sequence degradation. While the
    majority of venom genes have specialized expression in the venom gland,
    recent losses of venom function occur primarily among genes that show
    broader expression in development, suggesting that they can more readily
    switch functional roles. We propose that co-option of single-copy genes may
    be a common but relatively understudied mechanism of evolution for new gene
    functions, particularly under conditions of rapid evolutionary change.

    An accurate, comprehensive, non-redundant and up-to-date bibliography is a
    crucial component of any Model Organism Database (MOD). Principally, the
    bibliography provides a set of references that are specific to the field
    served by the MOD. Moreover, it serves as a backbone to which all curated
    biological data can be attributed. Here, we describe the organization and
    main features of the bibliography in FlyBase (flybase.org), the MOD for
    Drosophila melanogaster. We present an overview of the current content of
    the bibliography, the pipeline for identifying and adding new references,
    the presentation of data within Reference Reports and effective methods for
    searching and retrieving bibliographic data. We highlight recent
    improvements in these areas and describe the advantages of using the FlyBase
    bibliography over alternative literature resources. Although this article is
    focused on bibliographic data, many of the features and tools described are
    applicable to browsing and querying other datasets in FlyBase.

    Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) provides researchers
    with the ability to record genetic polymorphism across thousands of loci for
    nonmodel organisms, potentially revolutionizing the field of molecular
    ecology. However, as with other genotyping methods, RADseq is prone to a
    number of sources of error that may have consequential effects for
    population genetic inferences, and these have received only limited
    attention in terms of the estimation and reporting of genotyping error
    rates. Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of
    identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a
    reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (i) optimize de novo
    assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and
    maximizing the retrieval of informative loci; and (ii) quantify error rates
    for loci, alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As an empirical
    example, we use a double-digest RAD data set of a nonmodel plant species,
    Berberis alpina, collected from high-altitude mountains in Mexico.

    Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages in the brain, are damage sensors
    that react to nearly any perturbation, including neurodegenerative diseases
    such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we
    determined the transcriptome of more than 1,600 individual microglia cells
    isolated from the hippocampus of a mouse model of severe neurodegeneration
    with AD-like phenotypes and of control mice at multiple time points during
    progression of neurodegeneration. In this neurodegeneration model, we
    discovered two molecularly distinct reactive microglia phenotypes that are
    typified by modules of co-regulated type I and type II interferon response
    genes, respectively. Furthermore, our work identified previously unobserved
    heterogeneity in the response of microglia to neurodegeneration, discovered
    disease stage-specific microglia cell states, revealed the trajectory of
    cellular reprogramming of microglia in response to neurodegeneration, and
    uncovered the underlying transcriptional programs.

  abstract: >-
    Recent research into the flowering of rice (Oryza sativa) has revealed both
    unique and conserved genetic pathways in the photoperiodic control of
    flowering compared with those in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We
    discovered an early heading date2 (ehd2) mutant that shows extremely late
    flowering under both short- and long-day conditions in line with a
    background deficient in Heading date1 (Hd1), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that
    belongs to the conserved pathway. This phenotype in the ehd2 mutants
    suggests that Ehd2 is pivotal for the floral transition in rice. Map-based
    cloning revealed that Ehd2 encodes a putative transcription factor with zinc
    finger motifs orthologous to the INDETERMINATE1 (ID1) gene, which promotes
    flowering in maize (Zea mays). Ehd2 mRNA in rice tissues accumulated most
    abundantly in developing leaves, but was present at very low levels around
    the shoot apex and in roots, patterns that are similar to those of ID1. To
    assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we
    compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such
    as Ehd1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice
    florigens), between the wild-type plants and the ehd2 mutants. Severely
    reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day
    conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by
    up-regulating Ehd1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes
    in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice.

  abstract: >-
    Oryza sativa (rice) flowers in response to photoperiod, and is a facultative
    short-day (SD) plant. Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the
    activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice
    CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the
    Arabidopsis genome). On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions,
    flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and
    by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway
    in rice. We report here that an early heading date 3 (ehd3) mutant flowered
    later than wild-type plants, particularly under LD conditions, regardless of
    the Hd1-deficient background. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd3 encodes a
    nuclear protein that contains a putative transcriptional regulator with two
    plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motifs. To identify the role of Ehd3 within
    the gene regulatory network for rice flowering, we compared the transcript
    levels of genes related to rice flowering in wild-type plants and ehd3
    mutants. Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced
    transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants
    suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in
    floral induction. Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show
    higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a
    Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1. Our results
    demonstrate that the PHD-finger gene Ehd3 acts as a promoter in the unique
    genetic pathway responsible for photoperiodic flowering in rice.

  abstract: >-
    Metabolic plasticity, which largely relies on the creation of new genes, is
    an essential feature of plant adaptation and speciation and has led to the
    evolution of large gene families. A typical example is provided by the
    diversification of the cytochrome P450 enzymes in plants. We describe here a
    retroposition, neofunctionalization, and duplication sequence that, via
    selective and local amino acid replacement, led to the evolution of a novel
    phenolic pathway in Brassicaceae. This pathway involves a cascade of six
    successive hydroxylations by two partially redundant cytochromes P450,
    leading to the formation of
    N-1,N-5-di(hydroxyferuloyl)-N-10-sinapoylspermidine, a major pollen
    constituent and so-far-overlooked player in phenylpropanoid metabolism. This
    example shows how positive Darwinian selection can favor structured clusters
    of nonsynonymous substitutions that are needed for the transition of enzymes
    to new functions.

    Small, compact genomes of ultrasmall unicellular algae provide information
    on the basic and essential genes that support the lives of photosynthetic
    eukaryotes, including higher plants. Here we report the 16,520,305-base-pair
    sequence of the 20 chromosomes of the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon
    merolae 10D as the first complete algal genome. We identified 5,331 genes in
    total, of which at least 86.3% were expressed. Unique characteristics of
    this genomic structure include: a lack of introns in all but 26 genes; only
    three copies of ribosomal DNA units that maintain the nucleolus; and two
    dynamin genes that are involved only in the division of mitochondria and
    plastids. The conserved mosaic origin of Calvin cycle enzymes in this red
    alga and in green plants supports the hypothesis of the existence of single
    primary plastid endosymbiosis. The lack of a myosin gene, in addition to the
    unexpressed actin gene, suggests a simpler system of cytokinesis. These
    results indicate that the C. merolae genome provides a model system with a
    simple gene composition for studying the origin, evolution and fundamental
    mechanisms of eukaryotic cells.

    Recent losses of honey bee colonies have led to increased interest in the
    microbial communities that are associated with these important pollinators.
    A critical function that bacteria perform for their honey bee hosts, but one
    that is poorly understood, is the transformation of worker-collected pollen
    into bee bread, a nutritious food product that can be stored for long
    periods in colonies. We used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to comprehensively
    characterize in genetically diverse and genetically uniform colonies the
    active bacterial communities that are found on honey bees, in their
    digestive tracts, and in bee bread. This method provided insights that have
    not been revealed by past studies into the content and benefits of honey
    bee-associated microbial communities. Colony microbiotas differed
    substantially between sampling environments and were dominated by several
    anaerobic bacterial genera never before associated with honey bees, but
    renowned for their use by humans to ferment food. Colonies with genetically
    diverse populations of workers, a result of the highly promiscuous mating
    behavior of queens, benefited from greater microbial diversity, reduced
    pathogen loads, and increased abundance of putatively helpful bacteria,
    particularly species from the potentially probiotic genus Bifidobacterium.
    Across all colonies, Bifidobacterium activity was negatively correlated with
    the activity of genera that include pathogenic microbes; this relationship
    suggests a possible target for understanding whether microbes provide
    protective benefits to honey bees. Within-colony diversity shapes
    microbiotas associated with honey bees in ways that may have important
    repercussions for colony function and health. Our findings illuminate the
    importance of honey bee-bacteria symbioses and examine their intersection
    with nutrition, pathogen load, and genetic diversity, factors that are
    considered key to understanding honey bee decline.

    Programmed cell death is the most common fate of female germ cells in
    Drosophila and many animals. In Drosophila, oocytes form in individual egg
    chambers that are supported by germline nurse cells and surrounded by
    somatic follicle cells. As oogenesis proceeds, 15 nurse cells die for every
    oocyte that is produced. In addition to this developmentally regulated cell
    death, groups of germ cells or entire egg chambers may be induced to undergo
    apoptosis in response to starvation or other insults. Recent findings
    suggest that these different types of cell death involve distinct genetic
    pathways. This review focuses on progress towards elucidating the molecular
    mechanisms acting during programmed cell death in Drosophila oogenesis. (C)

    We developed a method for systematically comparing gene expression patterns
    across organisms using genome-wide comparative analysis of DNA microarray
    experiments. We identified analogous gene expression programs comprising
    shared patterns of regulation across orthologous genes. Biological features
    of these patterns could be identified as highly conserved subpatterns that
    correspond to Gene Ontology categories. Here, we demonstrate these methods
    by analyzing a specific biological process, aging, and show that similar
    analysis can be applied to a range of biological processes. We found that
    two highly diverged animals, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the
    fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, implement a shared adult-onset expression
    program of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, DNA repair,
    catabolism, peptidolysis and cellular transport. Most of these changes were
    implemented early in adulthood. Using this approach to search databases of
    gene expression data, we found conserved transcriptional signatures in
    larval development, embryogenesis, gametogenesis and mRNA degradation.

  abstract: >-
    BACKGROUND: The cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1 is overtranscribed in all field
    isolates of DDT-resistant Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) and confers a
    fitness advantage when inherited via the female. Overtranscription is
    associated with the insertion of an Accord transposable element into the 5′
    end of the resistance allele. Here the authors attempt to dissect the
    transcription of the P450 gene in order to understand why resistance confers
    an advantage rather than the expected cost. RESULTS: Using a transgenic
    UAS:GAL4 reporter, the authors document the overexpression patterns of green
    fluorescent protein (GFP) in the fat body, midgut and Malpighian tubules
    driven by flies carrying the resistant 5′ construct. Knockout of Cyp6g1 via
    RNAi decreases both the level of Cyp6g1 transcript and the metabolism of the
    artificial substrate MROD (methyl ether resorufin, Sigma M1544). RNAi does
    not, however, significantly increase the susceptibility of susceptible flies
    to DDT. Finally, quantification of Cyp6g1 RNA in embryos laid by resistant
    females indicates that they pass on more Cyp6g1 RNA to their progeny than
    their susceptible counterparts. CONCLUSION: These results help explain why
    the eggs and larvae of resistant females enjoy a fitness benefit rather than
    a cost, and suggest that the provisioning of Cyp6g1 RNA to embryos provides
    a direct, but uncharacterised, fitness benefit. Copyright © 2008 Society of

    Deep shotgun sequencing on next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms has
    contributed significant amounts of data to enrich our understanding of
    genomes, transcriptomes, amplified single-cell genomes, and metagenomes.
    However, deep coverage variations in short-read data sets and high
    sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present new computational
    challenges in data interpretation, including mapping and de novo assembly.
    New lab techniques such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of
    single cells and sequence independent single primer amplification (SISPA)
    allow for sequencing of organisms that cannot be cultured, but generate
    highly variable coverage due to amplification biases.

    Increasing food production is essential to meet the demands of a growing
    human population, with its rising income levels and nutritional
    expectations. To address the demand, plant breeders seek new sources of
    genetic variation to enhance the productivity, sustainability and resilience
    of crop varieties. Here we launch a high-resolution, open-access research
    platform to facilitate genome-wide association mapping in rice, a staple
    food crop. The platform provides an immortal collection of diverse
    germplasm, a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism data set tailored
    for gene discovery, well-documented analytical strategies, and a suite of
    bioinformatics resources to facilitate biological interpretation. Using
    grain length, we demonstrate the power and resolution of our new
    high-density rice array, the accompanying genotypic data set, and an
    expanded diversity panel for detecting major and minor effect QTLs and
    subpopulation-specific alleles, with immediate implications for rice
    improvement.

    Background: To what extent are the determinants of aging in animal species
    universal? Insulin/ insulin-like growth factor ( IGF)-1 signaling ( IIS) is
    an evolutionarily conserved ( public) regulator of longevity; yet it remains
    unclear whether the genes and biochemical processes through which IIS acts
    on aging are public or private ( that is, lineage specific). To address
    this, we have applied a novel, multi-level cross-species comparative
    analysis to compare gene expression changes accompanying increased longevity
    in mutant nematodes, fruitflies and mice with reduced IIS.Results:
    Surprisingly, there is little evolutionary conservation at the level of
    individual, orthologous genes or paralogous genes under IIS regulation.
    However, a number of gene categories are significantly enriched for genes
    whose expression changes in long-lived animals of all three species.
    Down-regulated categories include protein biosynthesis-associated genes.
    Up-regulated categories include sugar catabolism, energy generation,
    glutathione-S-transferases ( GSTs) and several other categories linked to
    cellular detoxification ( that is, phase 1 and phase 2 metabolism of
    xenobiotic and endobiotic toxins). Protein biosynthesis and GST activity
    have recently been linked to aging and longevity assurance,
    respectively.Conclusion: These processes represent candidate, regulated
    mechanisms of longevity-control that are conserved across animal species.
    The longevity assurance mechanisms via which IIS acts appear to be
    lineage-specific at the gene level ( private), but conserved at the process
    level ( or semi-public). In the case of GSTs, and cellular detoxification
    generally, this suggests that the mechanisms of aging against which
    longevity assurance mechanisms act are, to some extent, lineage specific.

    In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, formation of the long-lived dauer
    larva and adult aging are both controlled by insulin/insulin-like growth
    factor-1 signaling. Potentially, increased adult life span in daf-2
    insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor mutants results from
    mis-expression in the adult of a dauer larva longevity program. By using
    oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we identified a dauer transcriptional
    signature in daf-2 mutant adults. By means of a nonbiased statistical
    approach, we identified gene classes whose expression is altered similarly
    in dauers and daf-2 mutants, which represent potential determinants of life
    span. These include known determinants of longevity; the small heat shock
    protein/alpha-crystallins are up-regulated in both milieus. The cytochrome
    P450, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and
    glutathione S-transferase (in daf-2 mutants) gene classes were also
    up-regulated. These four gene classes act together in metabolism and
    excretion of toxic endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolites. This suggests that
    diverse toxic lipophilic and electrophilic metabolites, disposed of by phase
    1 and phase 2 drug metabolism, may be the major determinants of the
    molecular damage that causes aging. In addition, we observed down-regulation
    of genes linked to nutrient uptake, including nhx-2 and pep-2. These work
    together in the uptake of dipeptides in the intestine, implying dietary
    restriction in daf-2 mutants. Some gene groups up-regulated in dauers and/or
    daf-2 were enriched for certain promoter elements as follows: the
    daf-16-binding element, the heat shock-response element, the heat
    shock-associated sequence, or the hif-1-response element. By contrast, the
    daf-16-associated element was enriched in genes down-regulated in dauers and
    daf-2 mutants. Thus, particular promoter elements appear
    longevity-associated or aging associated.

    Genomic analyses have proliferated without being tied to tangible
    phenotypes. For example, although coordination of both gene expression and
    genetic linkage have been offered as genetic mechanisms for the frequently
    observed clustering of genes participating in fungal metabolic pathways,
    elucidation of the phenotype(s) favored by selection, resulting in cluster
    formation and maintenance, has not been forthcoming. We noted that the cause
    of certain well-studied human metabolic disorders is the accumulation of
    toxic intermediate compounds (ICs), which occurs when the product of an
    enzyme is not used as a substrate by a downstream neighbor in the metabolic
    network. This raises the hypothesis that the phenotype favored by selection
    to drive gene clustering is the mitigation of IC toxicity. To test this, we
    examined 100 diverse fungal genomes for the simplest type of cluster, gene
    pairs that are both metabolic neighbors and chromosomal neighbors
    immediately adjacent to each other, which we refer to as "double neighbor
    gene pairs" (DNGPs). Examination of the toxicity of their corresponding ICs
    shows that, compared with chromosomally nonadjacent metabolic neighbors,
    DNGPs are enriched for ICs that have acutely toxic LD50 doses or reactive
    functional groups. Furthermore, DNGPs are significantly more likely to be
    divergently oriented on the chromosome; remarkably, ∼40% of these DNGPs have
    ICs known to be toxic. We submit that the structure of synteny in metabolic
    pathways of fungi is a signature of selection for protection against the
    accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates.

    Until recently, ectopic gene expression in Drosophila was largely
    accomplished through the use of the heatshock promoter, which provides the
    experimenter with temporal control over transgene induction, or the GAL4-UAS
    system, which provides the experimenter with spatial control over transgene
    expression. But significant advances have now been made in combining the
    attributes of temporal and spatial control over gene expression into a
    single system. In this article, we review the progress on the development
    and implementation of several gene expression systems that offer control in
    time and space. These include systems employing the yeast FLP recombinase
    gene and FRT sites (FLP and/or FRT), tetracycline-responsive transcription
    factors (Tet-On and Tet-Off), steroid hormone responsive transcription
    factors (GeneSwiich and ER-GAL4) and temperature-sensitive repressors of the
    classical GAL4-UAS system (TARGET).

    The order Coleoptera (beetles) is arguably the most species-rich lineage of
    animals. Beetles exhibit an extraordinary variety of life histories and
    occupy most terrestrial environments. Whole genome sequences are available
    for 11 beetle species, only six of which have been published. Studies of
    beetle genomes have revealed remarkable new insights into the genomic basis
    and evolution of beetle life histories and other aspects of beetle
    biodiversity, including the genes underlying chemoperception,
    detoxification, and specialized plant feeding, as well as the role of
    horizontal gene transfer in elaboration of the beetle trophic repertoire.
    Nonetheless, such studies are in their infancy. The study of beetle genomes
    has the potential to further revolutionize our understanding of beetle
    biodiversity, but genomic studies of beetles remain seriously limited in
    scope and resolution by the very few genomes that are currently available
    for study.

    Studies of insecticide resistance allow theories of the adaptive process to
    be tested where the selective agent, the insecticide, is unambiguously
    defined. Thus, the consequences of selection of phenotypic variation can be
    investigated in genetic, biochemical, molecular, population biological and,
    most recently, developmental contexts. Are the options limited biochemically
    and molecularly? Is the genetic mechanism monogenic or polygenic, general or
    population/species specific? Are fitness and developmental patterns
    associated? These questions of general evolutionary significance can be
    considered with experimental approaches to determine how insecticide
    resistance evolves.

    Author Summary The term microbiome refers to the ecosystem of microbes that
    live in a defined environment. The decreasing cost and increasing speed of
    DNA sequencing technology has recently provided scientists with affordable
    and timely access to the genes and genomes of microbiomes that inhabit our
    planet and even our own bodies. In these investigations many microbiome
    samples are sequenced at the same time on the same DNA sequencing machine,
    but often result in total numbers of sequences per sample that are vastly
    different. The common procedure for addressing this difference in sequencing
    effort across samples – different library sizes – is to either (1) base
    analyses on the proportional abundance of each species in a library, or (2)
    rarefy, throw away sequences from the larger libraries so that all have the
    same, smallest size. We show that both of these normalization methods can
    work when comparing obviously-different whole microbiomes, but that neither
    method works well when comparing the relative proportions of each bacterial
    species across microbiome samples. We show that alternative methods based on
    a statistical mixture model perform much better and can be easily adapted
    from a separate biological sub-discipline, called RNA-Seq analysis.

    Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga whose lineage diverged
    from land plants over 1 billion years ago. It is a model system for studying
    chloroplast-based photosynthesis, as well as the structure, assembly, and
    function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia), which were inherited from the
    common ancestor of plants and animals, but lost in land plants. We sequenced
    the approximately 120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed
    comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding
    uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and
    biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the
    Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic
    cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and
    flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the
    composition and function of flagella.

    INTRODUCTION

    The large amount of DNA sequence data generated by high-throughput
    sequencing technologies often allows multiple samples to be sequenced in
    parallel on a single sequencing run. This is particularly true if subsets of
    the genome are studied rather than complete genomes. In recent years, target
    capture from sequencing libraries has largely replaced polymerase chain
    reaction (PCR) as the preferred method of target enrichment. Parallelizing
    target capture and sequencing for multiple samples requires the
    incorporation of sample-specific barcodes into sequencing libraries, which
    is necessary to trace back the sample source of each sequence. This protocol
    describes a fast and reliable method for the preparation of barcoded
    (“indexed”) sequencing libraries for Illumina’s Genome Analyzer platform.
    The protocol avoids expensive commercial library preparation kits and can be
    performed in a 96-well plate setup using multi-channel pipettes, requiring
    not more than two or three days of lab work. Libraries can be prepared from
    any type of double-stranded DNA, even if present in subnanogram quantity.

  abstract: >-
    This paper discusses aspects of the relationship between the scientific
    community and the public at large. Inspired by the European public debate on
    genetically modified crops and food, ethical challenges to the scientific
    community are highlighted. This is done by a discussion of changes that are
    likely to occur to journalistic attitudes - mirroring changing attitudes in
    the wider society - towards science and scientific researchers. Two
    journalistic conventions - those of science transmission and of
    investigative journalism - are presented and discussed in relation to the
    present drive towards commercialization within the world of science: how are
    journalists from these different schools of thought likely to respond to the
    trend of commercialization? Likely journalistic reactions could, while
    maintaining the authority of the scientific method, be expected to undermine
    public trust in scientists. In the long term, this may lead to an erosion of
    the idea of knowledge as something that cannot simply be reduced to the
    outcome of negotiation between stakeholders. It is argued that science is
    likely to be depicted as a fallen angel. This may be countered, it is
    posited, by science turning human, by recognizing its membership of society,
    and by recognizing that such membership entails more than just commercial
    relations. To rethink its relationship with the public at large - and, in
    particular, to rethink the ideal of disinterested science - is an ethical
    challenge facing the scientific community.

  abstract: >-
    The sustainability of malaria control in Africa is threatened by rising
    levels of insecticide resistance, and new tools to prevent malaria
    transmission are urgently needed. To gain a better understanding of the
    mosquito populations that transmit malaria, we sequenced the genomes of 765
    wild specimens of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii sampled from 15
    locations across Africa. The data reveal high levels of genetic diversity,
    with over 50 million single nucleotide polymorphisms across the 230 Mbp
    genome. We observe complex patterns of population structure and marked
    variations in local population size, some of which may be due at least in
    part to malaria control interventions. Insecticide resistance genes show
    strong signatures of recent selection associated with multiple independent
    mutations spreading over large geographical distances and between species.
    The genetic variability of natural populations substantially reduces the
    target space for novel gene-drive strategies for mosquito control. This
    large dataset provides a foundation for tracking the emergence and spread of
    insecticide resistance and developing new vector control tools.

  abstract: >-
    The emergence of next-generation sequencing platforms led to resurgence of
    research in whole-genome shotgun assembly algorithms and software. DNA
    sequencing data from the Roche 454, Illumina/Solexa, and ABI SOLiD platforms
    typically present shorter read lengths, higher coverage, and different error
    profiles compared with Sanger sequencing data. Since 2005, several assembly
    software packages have been created or revised specifically for de novo
    assembly of next-generation sequencing data. This review summarizes and
    compares the published descriptions of packages named SSAKE, SHARCGS, VCAKE,
    Newbler, Celera Assembler, Euler, Velvet, ABySS, AllPaths, and SOAPdenovo.
    More generally, it compares the two standard methods known as the de Bruijn
    graph approach and the overlap/layout/consensus approach to assembly.

    Summary. Worker bees eventually begin laying eggs in honey bee colonies that
    have lost their queen and have failed to rear a replacement. In contrast,
    workers tend to lack developed ovaries and tend to suppress drone production
    by worker nestmates in colonies with queens. We measured changes in worker
    egg-removal behaviour, ovary development, and egg-laying rate in hives
    following the removal of their queens. We carried out weekly assays of
    worker removal of experimentally transferred eggs, dissection and inspection
    of worker bee ovaries, and daily checks of worker oviposition. Following
    queen removal, the egg-removal rate by workers generally first increased,
    then decreased or levelled off over the four-week time course of the
    experiment; this behaviour was closely synchronized with the increase in
    worker ovary development and egg-laying. We discuss our results in the
    context of theoretically predicted worker-worker conflict over the onset of
    reproduction in queenless honey bee societies.

  abstract: >-
    Microsomal P450 enzymes, which metabolize drugs and catalyze steroid
    biosynthesis. require electron donation from NADPH via P450 oxidoreductase
    (POR). POR knockout mice are embryonically lethal, but we found recessive
    human POR missense mutations causing disordered steroidogenesis and
    Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS), a skeletal malformation syndrome featuring
    craniosynostosis. Dominant mutations in exons 8 and 10 of fibroblast growth
    factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) cause phenotypically related craniosynostosis
    syndromes and were reported in patients with ABS and normal steroidogenesis.
    Sequencing POR and FGFR2 exons in 32 patients with ABS and/or hormonal
    findings suggesting POR deficiency showed complete genetic segregation of
    POR and FGFR2 mutations. Fifteen patients carried POR mutations on both
    alleles, four carried POR mutations on 1 allele, nine carried FGFR2/3
    mutations on one allele and no mutation was found in three patients. The 34
    affected POR alleles included 10 with A287P, 7 with R457H, 9 other missense
    mutations and 7 frameshifts. These 11 missense mutations and 10 others
    identified by database mining were expressed in E. coli, purified to
    apparent homogeneity, and their catalytic capacities were measured in four
    assays: reduction of cytochrome c, oxidation of NADPH, and support of the 17
    alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities of human P450c17. As assessed
    by V-max/K-m, 17,20 lyase activity provided the best correlation with
    clinical findings. Modeling human POR on the X-ray crystal structure of rat
    POR shows that these mutant activities correlate well with their locations
    in the structure. POR deficiency is a new disease, distinct from the
    craniosynostosis syndromes caused by FGFR mutations.

    Drosophila mojavensis and other species of the mulleri subgroup contain a
    duplicate gene encoding the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Studies on
    the genetic relationship of the two genes using electrophoretic variants
    show them to be closely linked. We have cloned a 13.5-kb fragment of D.
    mojavensis DNA into the lambda vector, Charon 30. This fragment contains
    both Adh genes separated by approximately 2 kb of DNA. The clone hybridized
    to a single position on chromosome 3 in D. mojavensis following in situ
    hybridization. It is likely that the genes are tandemly arranged in the
    genome. One of the two genes shows a complexity in its structure that
    suggests the close linkage of a pseudogene or part of a gene. The structure
    of the Adh locus in five species of the mulleri subgroup have been compared
    by constructing restriction maps of genomic DNA. Two of these species D.
    arizonensis and D. mojavensis express Adh-1 in the ovaries; the others do
    not. In comparing these species it is evident that there has been one or two
    insertions into the region between the Adh genes. It is possible that one of
    these structural changes is related to the change in Adh tissue-specific
    expression that has occurred during the evolution of these species.

  abstract: >-
    The Drosophila eggshell is an extracellular matrix that confers protection
    to the egg and also plays a role in transferring positional information from
    the ovary to pattern the embryo. Among the constituents of the Drosophila
    eggshell, Nasrat, Polehole, and Closca form a group of proteins related by
    sequence, secreted by the oocyte, and mutually required for their
    incorporation into the eggshell. Besides their role in eggshell integrity,
    Nasrat, Polehole, and Closca are also required for embryonic terminal
    patterning by anchoring or stabilizing Torso-like at the eggshell. Here, we
    show that they are also required for dorsoventral patterning, thereby
    unveiling that the dorsoventral and terminal systems, hitherto considered
    independent, share a common extracellular step. Furthermore, we show that
    Nasrat, Polehole, and Closca are required for proper Nudel activity, a
    protease acting both in embryonic dorsoventral patterning and eggshell
    integrity, thus providing a means to account for the role of Nasrat,
    Polehole, and Closca. We propose that a Nasrat/Polehole/Closca complex acts
    as a multifunctional hub to anchor various proteins synthesized at
    oogenesis, ensuring their spatial and temporal restricted function.

    Although the nuclear genome sequence of Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D, a
    unicellular red alga, was recently determined, DNA transformation technology
    that is important as a model plant system has never been available thus far.
    In this study, improved culture conditions resulted in a faster growth rate
    of C. merolae in liquid medium (doubling time = 9.2 h), and colony formation
    on gellan gum plates. Using these conditions, spontaneous mutants
    (5-fluoroortic acid resistant) deficient in the UMP synthase gene were
    isolated. The lesions were then restored by introducing the wild-type UMP
    synthase gene into the cells suggesting DNA transformation by homologous
    recombination.

  abstract: >-
    Living organisms, from bacteria to humans, display a coordinated
    transcriptional response to xenobiotic exposure, inducing enzymes and
    transporters that facilitate detoxification. Several transcription factors
    have been identified in vertebrates that contribute to this regulatory
    response. In contrast, little is known about this pathway in insects. Here
    we show that the Drosophila Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) ortholog CncC (cap
    'n' collar isoform-C) is a central regulator of xenobiotic detoxification
    responses. A binding site for CncC and its heterodimer partner Maf (muscle
    aponeurosis fibromatosis) is sufficient and necessary for robust
    transcriptional responses to three xenobiotic compounds: phenobarbital (PB),
    chlorpromazine, and caffeine. Genetic manipulations that alter the levels of
    CncC or its negative regulator, Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1),
    lead to predictable changes in xenobiotic-inducible gene expression.
    Transcriptional profiling studies reveal that more than half of the genes
    regulated by PB are also controlled by CncC. Consistent with these effects
    on detoxification gene expression, activation of the CncC/Keap1 pathway in
    Drosophila is sufficient to confer resistance to the lethal effects of the
    pesticide malathion. These studies establish a molecular mechanism for the
    regulation of xenobiotic detoxification in Drosophila and have implications
    for controlling insect populations and the spread of insect-borne human
    diseases.

  abstract: >-
    Sequencing microRNA, reduced representation sequencing, Hi-C technology and
    any method requiring the use of in-house barcodes result in sequencing
    libraries with low initial sequence diversity. Sequencing such data on the
    Illumina platform typically produces low quality data due to the limitations
    of the Illumina cluster calling algorithm. Moreover, even in the case of
    diverse samples, these limitations are causing substantial inaccuracies in
    multiplexed sample assignment (sample bleeding). Such inaccuracies are
    unacceptable in clinical applications, and in some other fields (e.g.
    detection of rare variants). Here, we discuss how both problems with quality
    of low-diversity samples and sample bleeding are caused by incorrect
    detection of clusters on the flowcell during initial sequencing cycles. We
    propose simple software modifications (Long Template Protocol) that overcome
    this problem. We present experimental results showing that our Long Template
    Protocol remarkably increases data quality for low diversity samples, as
    compared with the standard analysis protocol; it also substantially reduces
    sample bleeding for all samples. For comprehensiveness, we also discuss and
    compare experimental results from alternative approaches to sequencing low
    diversity samples. First, we discuss how the low diversity problem, if
    caused by barcodes, can be avoided altogether at the barcode design stage.
    Second and third, we present modified guidelines, which are more stringent
    than the manufacturer’s, for mixing low diversity samples with diverse
    samples and lowering cluster density, which in our experience consistently
    produces high quality data from low diversity samples. Fourth and fifth, we
    present rescue strategies that can be applied when sequencing results in low
    quality data and when there is no more biological material available. In
    such cases, we propose that the flowcell be re-hybridized and sequenced
    again using our Long Template Protocol. Alternatively, we discuss how
    analysis can be repeated from saved sequencing images using the Long
    Template Protocol to increase accuracy.

    Identification of alleles that improve crop production and lead to
    higher-yielding varieties are needed for food security. Here we show that
    the quantitative trait locus WFP (WEALTHY FARMER'S PANICLE) encodes OsSPL14
    (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 14, also known as IPA1). Higher
    expression of OsSPL14 in the reproductive stage promotes panicle branching
    and higher grain yield in rice. OsSPL14 controls shoot branching in the
    vegetative stage and is affected by microRNA excision. We also demonstrate
    the feasibility of using the OsSLP14(WFP) allele to increase rice crop
    yield. Introduction of the high-yielding OsSPL14(WFP) allele into the
    standard rice variety Nipponbare resulted in increased rice production.

  abstract: >-
    Insecticidal activity of Angelica acutiloba extract and its constituents was
    investigated and compared with that of rotenone. Bioassay-guided isolation
    of the chloroform extract of A. acutiloba against larvae of Drosophila
    melanogaster afforded two phthalides, (Z)-butylidenephthalide (1) and
    (Z)-ligustilide (2), and two furanocoumarins, xanthotoxin (3) and
    isopimpinellin (4). The structures of these compounds were established by
    spectroscopic analysis. The isolated compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 exhibited LC50
    values of 0.94, 2.54, 3.35, and 0.82 mumol/mL of diet concentration against
    larvae of D. melanogaster, respectively. Against both sexes (males/females,
    1:1) of adults (5-7 days old), compound 1 showed the most potent activity
    with a LD50 value of 0.84 mug/adult. Compound 1 is a more active insecticide
    than rotenone (LD50 = 3.68 mug/adult) and has potential as a novel insect
    control agent. However, compound 2 was inactive against adults. The
    structure-activity relationship of phthalides isolated indicated that the
    aromaticity appeared to play an important role in the activity of both
    larvae and adults. To determine the insecticide mode of action for acute
    adulticidal activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity was
    also investigated in vitro, and the result indicated that the acute
    adulticidal activity of compounds 3 and 4 was due to the inhibition of AChE.

  abstract: >-
    Evidence of off-target effects (OTEs) associated with small interfering
    (si)RNAs (19-29 bp) in mammalian cells has existed for several years. Two
    recent articles demonstrate that short sequences within long double-stranded
    (ds)RNAs frequently cause undesirable OTEs in cultured Drosophila cells.
    These results reveal the potential for high false-positive rates in RNA
    interference (RNAi) screens using long dsRNAs and highlight the need for
    screening with multiple, non-overlapping long dsRNAs or siRNAs. Discovering
    multiple potent siRNAs with minimal off-target profiles for each target
    transcript will be invaluable for genome-based studies of gene function and
    for personalized RNAi therapeutics.

    Mutations in optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial
    protein, is the most common cause for autosomal dominant optic atrophy
    (DOA). The condition is characterized by gradual loss of vision, color
    vision defects, and temporal optic pallor. To understand the molecular
    mechanism by which OPA1 mutations cause optic atrophy and to facilitate the
    development of an effective therapeutic agent for optic atrophies, we
    analyzed phenotypes in the developing and adult Drosophila eyes produced by
    mutant dOpa1 (CG8479), a Drosophila ortholog of human OPA1. Heterozygous
    mutation of dOpa1 by a P-element or transposon insertions causes no
    discernable eye phenotype, whereas the homozygous mutation results in
    embryonic lethality. Using powerful Drosophila genetic techniques, we
    created eye-specific somatic clones. The somatic homozygous mutation of
    dOpa1 in the eyes caused rough (mispatterning) and glossy (decreased lens
    and pigment deposition) eye phenotypes in adult flies; this phenotype was
    reversible by precise excision of the inserted P-element. Furthermore, we
    show the rough eye phenotype is caused by the loss of hexagonal lattice
    cells in developing eyes, suggesting an increase in lattice cell apoptosis.
    In adult flies, the dOpa1 mutation caused an increase in reactive oxygen
    species (ROS) production as well as mitochondrial fragmentation associated
    with loss and damage of the cone and pigment cells. We show that superoxide
    dismutase 1 (SOD1), Vitamin E, and genetically overexpressed human SOD1
    (hSOD1) is able to reverse the glossy eye phenotype of dOPA1 mutant large
    clones, further suggesting that ROS play an important role in cone and
    pigment cell death. Our results show dOpa1 mutations cause cell loss by two
    distinct pathogenic pathways. This study provides novel insights into the
    pathogenesis of optic atrophy and demonstrates the promise of antioxidants
    as therapeutic agents for this condition.

    Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) is a curated online resource for
    comparative functional genomics in crops and model plant species, currently
    hosting 27 fully and 10 partially sequenced reference genomes in its build
    number 38. Its strength derives from the application of a phylogenetic
    framework for genome comparison and the use of ontologies to integrate
    structural and functional annotation data. Whole-genome alignments
    complemented by phylogenetic gene family trees help infer syntenic and
    orthologous relationships. Genetic variation data, sequences and genome
    mappings available for 10 species, including Arabidopsis, rice and maize,
    help infer putative variant effects on genes and transcripts. The pathways
    section also hosts 10 species-specific metabolic pathways databases
    developed in-house or by our collaborators using Pathway Tools software,
    which facilitates searches for pathway, reaction and metabolite annotations,
    and allows analyses of user-defined expression datasets. Recently, we
    released a Plant Reactome portal featuring 133 curated rice pathways. This
    portal will be expanded for Arabidopsis, maize and other plant species. We
    continue to provide genetic and QTL maps and marker datasets developed by
    crop researchers. The project provides a unique community platform to
    support scientific research in plant genomics including studies in
    evolution, genetics, plant breeding, molecular biology, biochemistry and
    systems biology.

  abstract: >-
    De novo assembly of a complete transcriptome without the need for a guiding
    reference genome is attractive, particularly where the cost and complexity
    of generating a eukaryote genome is prohibitive. The transcriptome should
    not however be seen as just a quick and cheap alternative to building a
    complete genome. Transcriptomics allows the understanding and comparison of
    spatial and temporal samples within an organism, and allows surveying of
    multiple individuals or closely related species. De novo assembly in theory
    allows the building of a complete transcriptome without any prior knowledge
    of the genome. It also allows the discovery of alternate splice forms of
    coding RNAs and also non-coding RNAs, which are often missed by proteomic
    approaches, or are incompletely annotated in genome studies. The limitations
    of the method are that the generation of a truly complete assembly is
    unlikely, and so we require some methods for the assessment of the quality
    and appropriateness of a generated transcriptome. Whilst no single consensus
    pipeline or tool is agreed as optimal, various algorithms and easy to use
    software do exist making transcriptome generation a more common approach.
    With this expansion of data, questions still exist relating to how do we
    make these datasets fully discoverable, comparable and most useful to
    understand complex biological systems?

  abstract: >-
    Plasma lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels are largely determined by variation in
    the LPA gene, which codes for apo(a). Genome-wide association studies
    (GWASs) have identified nonsynonymous variants in LPA that associate with
    low Lp(a) levels, although their effect on apo(a) function is unknown. We
    investigated two such variants, R990Q and R1771C, which were present in four
    null Lp(a) individuals, for structural and functional effects. Sequence
    alignments showed the R990 and R1771 residues to be highly conserved and
    homologous to each other and to residues associated with plasminogen
    deficiency. Structural modeling showed both residues to make several polar
    contacts with neighboring residues that would be ablated on substitution.
    Recombinant expression of the WT and R1771C apo(a) in liver and kidney cells
    showed an abundance of an immature form for both apo(a) proteins. A mature
    form of apo(a) was only seen with the WT protein. Imaging of the recombinant
    apo(a) proteins in conjunction with markers of the secretory pathway
    indicated a poor transit of R1771C into the Golgi. Furthermore, the R1771C
    mutant displayed a glycosylation pattern consistent with ER, but not Golgi,
    glycosylation. We conclude that R1771 and the equivalent R990 residue
    facilitate correct folding of the apo(a) kringle structure and mutations at
    these positions prevent the proper folding required for full maturation and
    secretion. To our knowledge, this is the first example of nonsynonymous
    variants in LPA being causative of a null Lp(a) phenotype.

    The role for royal jelly (RJ) in promoting caste differentiation of honeybee
    larvae into queens rather than workers is well characterized. A recent study
    demonstrated that this poorly understood complex nutrition drives strikingly
    similar phenotypic effects in Drosophila melanogaster, such as increased
    body size and reduced developmental time, making possible the use of D.
    melanogaster as a model system for the genetic analysis of the cellular
    mechanisms underlying RJ and caste differentiation. We demonstrate here that
    RJ increases the body size of some wild-type strains of D. melanogaster but
    not others, and report significant delays in developmental time in all flies
    reared on RJ. These findings suggest that cryptic genetic variation may be a
    factor in the D. melanogaster response to RJ, and should be considered when
    attempting to elucidate response mechanisms to environmental changes in
    non-honeybee species.

    The aim of this study was to determine the influence of different shoe-pedal
    interfaces and of an active pulling-up action during the upstroke phase on
    the pedalling technique. Eight elite cyclists (C) and seven non-cyclists
    (NC) performed three different bouts at 90 rev.min(-1) and 60% of their
    maximal aerobic power. They pedalled with single pedals (PED), with clipless
    pedals (CLIP) and with a pedal force feedback (CLIPFBACK) where subjects
    were asked to pull up on the pedal during the upstroke. There was no
    significant difference for pedalling effectiveness, net mechanical
    efficiency (NE) and muscular activity between PED and CLIP. When compared to
    CLIP, CLIPFBACK resulted in a significant increase in pedalling
    effectiveness during upstroke (86% for C and 57% NC, respectively), as well
    as higher biceps femoris and tibialis anterior muscle activity (p < 0.001).
    However, NE was significantly reduced (p < 0.008) with 9% and 3.3% reduction
    for C and NC, respectively. Consequently, shoe-pedal interface (PED vs.
    CLIP) did not significantly influence cycling technique during submaximal
    exercise. However, an active pulling-up action on the pedal during upstroke
    increased the pedalling effectiveness, while reducing net mechanical
    efficiency.

    Many Drosophila cytochrome P450 or Cyp genes are induced by caffeine and
    phenobarbital (PB). To understand the induction mechanism, we created
    Drosophila S2 cell lines stably transformed with different luciferase
    reporter plasmids carrying upstream DNAs of Cyp6a8 allele of the resistant
    91-R strain, and the 1.1-kb upstream DNAs of Cyp6g1 of the 91-R and the
    susceptible 91-C strains. Following 24 h treatment with
    dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), caffeine or PB, luciferase activity
    of all cell lines was determined. Results showed that the 0.1-kb DNA of
    Cyp6a8 and the upstream DNAs of Cyp6g1 from both strains are not induced by
    these chemicals in S2 cells. However, the 0.2-, 0.5- and 0.8-kb DNAs of
    Cyp6a8 showed 13-24-, 4-5- and 2.2-2.7-fold induction with caffeine, PB and
    DDT, respectively. These DNAs also showed a 2-3-fold synergistic effect of
    caffeine and PB but not of caffeine and DDT. The results suggest that the
    cis-regulatory elements for all three chemicals are located within the
    -11/-199 DNA of Cyp6a8. Furthermore, caffeine and PB inductions appear to be
    mediated via different cis-elements, whereas caffeine and DDT induction may
    involve common regulatory elements. These stably transformed cell lines
    should help understand the mechanism of resistance-associated Cyp gene
    overexpression in Drosophila.

    Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are conserved molecular chaperones that are
    upregulated following exposure to environmental stress and during aging. The
    mechanisms underlying the aging process are only beginning to be understood.
    The beneficial effects of Hsps on aging revealed in mild stress and
    overexpression experiments suggest that these proteins are part of an
    important cell protection system rather than being unspecific molecular
    chaperones. Among the Hsps families, small Hsps have the greatest influence
    on aging and the modulation of their expression during aging in Drosophila
    suggest that they are involved in pathways of longevity determination. (C)

  abstract: >-
    An esterase gene from the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus that is
    responsible for resistance to a variety of organophosphorus (OP)
    insecticides was cloned in lambda gt11 phage. This gene was used to
    investigate the genetic mechanism of the high production of the esterase B1
    it encodes in OP-resistant Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Tem-R strain) from
    California. Adults of the Tem-R strain were found to possess at least 250
    times more copies of the gene than adults of a susceptible strain (S-Lab).
    The finding that selection by pesticides may result in the amplification of
    genes encoding detoxifying enzymes in whole, normally developed, reproducing
    insects emphasizes the biological importance of this mechanism and opens new
    areas of investigation in pesticide resistance management.

    The full complement of homeobox transcription factor sequences, including
    genes and pseudogenes, was determined from the analysis of 10 complete
    genomes from flowering plants, moss, Selaginella, unicellular green algae,
    and red algae. Our exhaustive genome-wide searches resulted in the discovery
    in each class of a greater number of homeobox genes than previously
    reported. All homeobox genes can be unambiguously classified by sequence
    evolutionary analysis into 14 distinct classes also characterized by
    conserved intron-exon structure and by unique codomain architectures. We
    identified many new genes belonging to previously defined classes (HD-ZIP I
    to IV, BEL, KNOX, PLINC, WOX). Other newly identified genes allowed us to
    characterize PHD, DDT, NDX, and LD genes as members of four new evolutionary
    classes and to define two additional classes, which we named SAWADEE and
    PINTOX. Our comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify several newly
    characterized conserved motifs, including novel zinc finger motifs in
    SAWADEE and DDT. Members of the BEL and KNOX classes were found in
    Chlorobionta (green plants) and in Rhodophyta. We found representatives of
    the DDT, WOX, and PINTOX classes only in green plants, including unicellular
    green algae, moss, and vascular plants. All 14 homeobox gene classes were
    represented in flowering plants, Selaginella, and moss, suggesting that they
    had already differentiated in the last common ancestor of moss and vascular
    plants.

  abstract: >-
    Insects exposed to pesticides undergo strong natural selection and have
    developed various adaptive mechanisms to survive. Resistance to pyrethroid
    insecticides in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae is receiving increasing
    attention because it threatens the sustainability of malaria vector control
    programs in sub-Saharan Africa. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms
    conferring pyrethroid resistance gives insight into the processes of
    evolution of adaptive traits and facilitates the development of simple
    monitoring tools and novel strategies to restore the efficacy of
    insecticides. For this purpose, it is essential to understand which
    mechanisms are important in wild mosquitoes. Here, our aim was to identify
    enzymes that may be important in metabolic resistance to pyrethroids by
    measuring gene expression for over 250 genes potentially involved in
    metabolic resistance in phenotyped individuals from a highly resistant, wild
    A. gambiae population from Ghana. A cytochrome P450, CYP6P3, was
    significantly overexpressed in the survivors, and we show that the
    translated enzyme metabolises both alpha-cyano and non-alpha-cyano
    pyrethroids. This is the first study to demonstrate the capacity of a P450
    identified in wild A. gambiae to metabolise insecticides. The findings add
    to the understanding of the genetic basis of insecticide resistance in wild
    mosquito populations.

  abstract: >-
    1. Winged morph production in aphids is a phenotypic trait that has
    traditionally been seen as a response to unfavourable environmental
    conditions. The evidence to support this theory is reviewed and the
    ecological and evolutionary significance of the findings is discussed. 2.
    The common assertion of poor host-plant nutritional quality leading to
    increased production of winged morphs does not always apply, particularly
    when the host-plant quality is exceptionally poor. The available data are
    skewed heavily towards Myzus persicae, and for this species the dynamical
    change in plant quality appears to be important with respect to wing
    induction. 3. Crowding may be a less influential stimulus for wing induction
    as study methods approach natural conditions experienced by aphids on their
    host plant. 4. The growing evidence that interactions with other organisms
    can induce the production of winged morphs by aphid colonies is reviewed. In
    the case of natural enemies, such a response by an aphid colony may be
    regarded as induced defence. Wing induction may also act as a means of
    transmission for a virus or fungal pathogen.

    We analysed spatial patterns of expression of a lacZ reporter gene in the
    gut of Drosophila larvae that had been transformed with a P-element-lacZ
    vector to identify regional differences in gene expression. lacZ-positive
    epithelial cells formed distinct domains with discrete transverse and
    longitudinal boundaries along the gut tube. Boundaries were often found at
    sites at which morphological boundaries were not obvious. The gut epithelium
    was subdivided into 36 compartments by the boundaries. We refer to these
    novel compartments as ”tissue compartments”. The lacZ-positive domain of
    each strain appeared as a single tissue compartment or as a combination of
    several tissue compartments. The tissue compartment is considered to be a
    unit of regional differentiation. The spatial organization of the tissue
    compartments may represent the ”floor plan”, determined by genes that
    control the regional differentiation of this non-segmental organ.

  abstract: >-
    A protein fragment of P450BM3 (residues 73-84) which participates in
    palmitoleate binding was subjected to scanning chimeragenesis. Amino acids
    73-84, 73-78, 75-80, and 78-82 were replaced with the homologous fragments
    of the insect terpenoid hydroxylase CYP4C7. The four chimeric proteins,
    C(73-84), C(73-78), C(75-80), and C(78-82), were expressed, purified, and
    characterized. All the chimeric proteins contained all the cofactors and
    catalyzed monooxygenation of palmitate and of the sesquiterpene farnesol.
    Chimeragenesis altered substrate binding as shown by the changes in the
    amplitude of the palmitate-induced type I spectral shift. C(78-82) had
    monooxygenase activities close to those of P450BM3, while the rest of the
    chimeric proteins had monooxygenase activities that were inhibited relative
    to that of wild-type P450BM3. The extent of inhibition of the chimeric
    proteins varied depending on the substrate, and in the case of C(73-84),
    farnesol and palmitate oxidation was inhibited by 1 and 4 orders of
    magnitude, respectively. H-1 NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS were used to
    identify products of farnesol and palmitate oxidation. Wild-type P450BM3 and
    all chimeric proteins catalyzed oxidation of farnesol with formation of
    9-hydroxyfarnesol and farnesol 10,11- and 2,3-epoxides. Three of the four
    chimeric proteins also formed a new compound, 5-hydroxyfarnesol, which was
    the major product in the case of C(73-78). In addition to hydroxylation of
    the C13-C15 atoms, the chimeric enzymes catalyze significant hydroxylation
    of the C10-C12 atoms of palmitate. In the case of C(78-82), the rates of
    formation of I land 12-hydroxypalmitates increased 7-fold compared to that
    of wild-type P450BM3 to 106 and 212 min(-1), respectively, while the rate of
    10-hydroxypalmitate synthesis increased from zero to 106 min(-1). Thus,
    chimeragenesis of the region of residues 73-84 of the substrate binding site
    shifted the regiospecificity of substrate oxidation toward the center of the
    farnesol and palmitate molecules.

  abstract: >-
    Diflavin reductases are enzymes which emerged as a gene fusion of ferredoxin
    (flavodoxin) reductase and flavodoxin. The enzymes of this family tightly
    bind two flavin cofactors, FAD and FMN, and catalyze transfer of the
    reducing equivalents from the two-electron donor NADPH to a variety of
    one-electron acceptors. Cytochrome P450 reductase (P450R), a flavoprotein
    subunit of sulfite reductase (SiR), and flavoprotein domains of naturally
    occurring flavocytochrome fusion enzymes like nitric oxide synthases (NOS)
    and the fatty acid hydroxylase from Bacillus megaterium are some of the
    enzymes of this family. In this review the results of the last decade of
    research are summarized, and some earlier results are reevaluated as well.
    The kinetic mechanism of cytochrome c reduction is analyzed in light of
    other results on flavoprotein interactions with nucleotides and cytochromes.
    The roles of the binding sites of the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin
    cofactors and conformational changes of the protein in electron transfer are
    discussed. It is proposed that minor conformational changes during catalysis
    can potentiate properties of the redox centers during the catalytic
    turnover. A function of the aromatic residue that shields the isoalloxazine
    ring of the FAD is also proposed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

    The interactions of protein components of the xenobiotic-metabolizing
    cytochrome P450 system, CYP6A1, P450 reductase, and cytochrome b5 from the
    house fly (Musca domestica) have been characterized. CYP6A1 activity is
    determined by the concentration of the CYP6A1–P450 reductase complex,
    regardless of which protein is present in excess. Both holo- and apo-b5
    stimulated CYP6A1 heptachlor epoxidase and steroid hydroxylase activities
    and influenced the regioselectivity of testosterone hydroxylation. The
    conversion of CYP6A1 to its P420 form was decreased by the addition of
    apo-b5. The effects of cytochrome b5 may involve allosteric modification of
    the P450 enzyme that modify the conformation of the active site. The overall
    stoichiometry of the P450 reaction was substrate-dependent. High uncoupling
    of CYP6A1 was observed with generation of hydrogen peroxide, in excess over
    the concomitant testosterone hydroxylation or heptachlor epoxidation.
    Inclusion of cytochrome b5 in the reconstituted system improved efficiency
    of oxygen consumption and electron utilization from NADPH, or coupling of
    the P450 reaction. Depending on the reconstitution conditions, coupling
    efficiency varied from 8 to 25% for heptachlor epoxidation, and from 11 to
    70% for testosterone hydroxylation. Because CYP6A1 is a P450 involved in
    insecticide resistance, this suggests that xenobiotic metabolism by
    constitutively overexpressed P450s may be linked to significant oxidative
    stress in the cell that may carry a fitness cost.

    in a range of biological phenomena. The relatively recent development of
    this more nuanced view presents a challenge to the biomedical research
    community on how best to assess the significance of reactive oxygen species
    and oxidative damage in biological systems. Considerable progress is being
    made in addressing these issues, and here we survey some recent developments
    for those contemplating research in this area.

    The African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima) was domesticated in West
    Africa 3000 years ago. Although less cultivated than the Asian rice (O.
    sativa), O. glaberrima landraces often display interesting adaptation to
    rustic environment (e.g. drought). Here, using RNA-seq technology, we were
    able to compare more than 12,000 transcripts between 9 O. glaberrima, 10
    wild O. barthii and one O. meridionalis individuals. With a synonymous
    nucleotide diversity πs = 0.0006 per site, O. glaberrima appears as the
    least genetically diverse crop grass ever documented. Using approximate
    Bayesian computation, we estimated that O. glaberrima experienced a severe
    bottleneck during domestication. This demographic scenario almost fully
    accounts for the pattern of genetic diversity across O. glaberrima genome as
    we detected very few outliers regions where positive selection may have
    further impacted genetic diversity. Moreover, the large excess of derived
    nonsynonymous substitution that we detected suggests that the O. glaberrima
    population suffered from the 'cost of domestication'. In addition, we used
    this genome-scale data set to demonstrate that (i) O. barthii genetic
    diversity is positively correlated with recombination rate and negatively
    with gene density, (ii) expression level is negatively correlated with
    evolutionary constraint, and (iii) one region on chromosome 5 (position 4-6
    Mb) exhibits a clear signature of introgression with a yet unidentified
    Oryza species. This work represents the first genome-wide survey of the
    African rice genetic diversity and paves the way for further comparison
    between the African and the Asian rice, notably regarding the genetics
    underlying domestication traits.

    Advances in sequencing technologies and increased access to sequencing
    services have led to renewed interest in sequence and genome assembly.
    Concurrently, new applications for sequencing have emerged, including gene
    expression analysis, discovery of genomic variants and metagenomics, and
    each of these has different needs and challenges in terms of assembly. We
    survey the theoretical foundations that underlie modern assembly and
    highlight the options and practical trade-offs that need to be considered,
    focusing on how individual features address the needs of specific
    applications. We also review key software and the interplay between
    experimental design and efficacy of assembly.

    OsMADS16. In contrast, two strong alleles of the dl locus, drooping
    leaf-superman1 (dl-sup1) and drooping leaf-superman2 (dl-sup2), cause the
    complete transformation of the gynoecium into stamens. In these strong
    mutants, many ectopic stamens are formed in the region where the gynoecium
    is produced in the wild-type flower and they are arranged in a non-whorled,
    alternate pattern. The intermediate allele dl-1 (T65), results in an
    increase in the number of stamens and stigmas, and carpels occasionally show
    staminoid characteristics. In the weakest mutant, dl-2, most of the flowers
    are normal. All four dl alleles cause midrib-less drooping leaves. The
    flower of the double mutant, spw1 dl-sup, produces incompletely
    differentiated organs indefinitely after palea-like organs are produced in
    the position where lodicules are formed in the wild-type flower. These
    incompletely differentiated organs are neither stamens nor carpels, but have
    partial floral identity. Based on genetic and molecular results, we
    postulate a model of stamen and carpel specification in rice, with DL as a
    novel gene controlling carpel identity and acting mutually and
    antagonistically to the class B gene, SPW1.

    Most mammalian cells have nuclei that contain DNA, which replicates during
    cell proliferation. DNA is destroyed by various developmental processes in
    mammals. It is degraded during programmed cell death that accompanies
    mammalian development. The nuclei of erythrocytes and eye lens fiber cells
    are also removed during their differentiation into mature cells. If DNA is
    not properly degraded in these processes, it can cause various diseases,
    including tissue atrophy, anemia, cataract, and autoimmune diseases, which
    indicates that DNA can be a pathogenic molecule. Here, I present how DNA is
    degraded during programmed cell death, erythroid cell differentiation, and
    lens cell differentiation. I discuss what might be or will be learned from
    understanding the molecular mechanisms of DNA degradation that occurs during
    mammalian development.

  abstract: >-
    In a genetic screen in a drnl-2 background, we isolated a loss-of-function
    allele in miR319a (miR319a(129)). Previously, miR319a has been postulated to
    play a role in leaf development based on the dramatic curled-leaf phenotype
    of plants that ectopically express miR319a (jaw-D). miR319a(129) mutants
    exhibit defects in petal and stamen development; petals are narrow and
    short, and stamens exhibit defects in anther development. The miR319a(129)
    loss-of-function allele contains a single-base change in the middle of the
    encoded miRNA, which reduces the ability of miR319a to recognize targets.
    Analysis of the expression patterns of the three members of the miR319 gene
    family (miR319a, miR319b, and miR319c) indicates that these genes have
    largely non-overlapping expression patterns suggesting that these genes have
    distinct developmental functions. miR319a functions by regulating the TCP
    transcription factors TCP2, TCP3, TCP4, TCP10, and TCP24; the level of RNA
    expression of these TCP genes is down-regulated in jaw-D and elevated in
    miR319a(129). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that TCP4 is a key
    target of miR319a. First, the tcp4(soj6) mutant, which contains a mutation
    in the TCP4 miRNA-binding site complementary to the miR319a(129) mutation,
    suppresses the flower phenotype of miR319a(129). Second, expression of
    wild-type TCP4 in petals and stamens (i.e., AP3:TCP4) has no effect on
    flower development; by contrast, a miRNA-resistant version of TCP4, when
    expressed in petals and stamens (i.e., pAP3:mTCP4) causes these organs not
    to develop. Surprisingly, when AP3:TCP4 is present in a miR319a(129)
    background, petal and stamen development is severely disrupted, suggesting
    that proper regulation by miR319a of TCP4 is critical in these floral
    organs.

  abstract: >-
    TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)/CENTRORADIALIS (CEN)-like genes play important
    roles in determining plant architecture, mainly by controlling the timing of
    phase transition. To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms
    operating in the control of inflorescence architecture in rice, we analysed
    the functions of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs. Constitutive
    overexpression of RCN1 or RCN2 in Arabidopsis caused a late-flowering and
    highly branching phenotype, indicating that they possess conserved
    biochemical functions as TFL1. In 35S::RCN1 and 35S::RCN2 transgenic rice
    plants, the delay of transition to the reproductive phase was observed. The
    transgenic rice plants exhibited a more branched, denser panicle morphology.
    Detailed observation of the panicle structure revealed that the phase change
    from the branch shoot to the floral meristem state was also delayed, leading
    to the generation of higher-order panicle branches. These results suggest
    rice has a pathway that can respond to the overexpressed TFL1/CEN-like
    functions, and the molecular mechanisms controlling the phase transition of
    meristems are conserved between grass and dicot species, at least to some
    extent.

    The whitebacked planthopper Sogatella furcifera is a serious pest of rice
    that has developed fipronil resistance in Asia. We found a novel R340Q
    mutation in the cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4 of the S. furcifera RDL
    γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit (SF-RDL). The R340Q mutation was
    found in clones carrying the A2′N mutation, which was previously implicated
    in fipronil resistance and suggested to be a heterozygous mutation. To
    investigate the influence of mutations, Drosophila Mel-2 cells were
    transfected with wild-type or mutant SF-RDL genes, either individually or
    together. A membrane potential assay showed that the influence of the
    A2′N·R340Q double mutation on fipronil resistance was more profound than
    that of the A2′N single mutation in the heterozygous expression of wild-type
    and mutant SF-RDL genes.

    We found the A2′N mutation (index number for M2 membrane spanning region) in
    the GABA receptor subunit of fipronil-resistant Sogatella furcifera, by
    analyzing DNA sequences amplified from fipronil-resistant and -susceptible
    S. furcifera. In order to confirm the role of A2′N mutation in the fipronil
    resistance, we expressed the wild-type and A2′N mutant Drosophila GABA
    receptors in Drosophila Mel-2 cells stably. Amino acid sequences of three
    membrane spanning regions (M1–M3), which are important for binding of
    fipronil, are conserved between Drosophila and S. furcifera. So the results
    of A2′N mutant Drosophila GABA receptor suggest the role of A2′N mutation in
    fipronil-resistant S. furcifera. The membrane potential assay showed that
    the A2′N mutant Drosophila GABA receptor was not inhibited by fipronil at
    all, while the IC50 value of fipronil for wild-type Drosophila GABA receptor
    was 172nM. These results suggest that A2′N mutation confers the resistance
    of fipronil in S. furcifera.

    The prothoracic gland (PG) has essential roles in synthesizing and secreting
    a steroid hormone called ecdysone that is critical for molting and
    metamorphosis of insects. However, little is known about the genes
    controlling ecdysteroidogenesis in the PG. To identify genes functioning in
    the PG of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we used differential display PCR and
    focused on a cytochrome P450 gene designated Cyp307a1. Its expression level
    positively correlates with a change in the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer. In
    addition, Drosophila Cyp307a1 is encoded in the spook locus, one of the
    Halloween mutant family members showing a low ecdysone titer in vivo,
    suggesting that Cyp307a1 is involved in ecdysone synthesis. While Drosophila
    Cyp307a1 is expressed in the early embryos and adult ovaries, the expression
    is not observed in the PGs of embryos or third instar larvae. These results
    suggest a difference in the ecdysone synthesis pathways during larval
    development in these insects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

    In Arabidopsis, stem cell homeostasis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is
    controlled by a feedback loop between WUS and CLV functions. We have
    identified WUS orthologues in maize and rice by a detailed phylogenetic
    analysis of the WOX gene family and subsequent cloning. A single WUS
    orthologue is present in the rice genome (OsWUS), whereas the allotetraploid
    maize genome contains 2 WUS paralogues (ZmWUS1 and ZmWUS2). None of the
    isolated grass WUS orthologues displays an organizing center-type expression
    pattern in the vegetative SAM as in Arabidopsis. In contrast, the
    grass-specific expression patterns relate to the specification of new
    phytomers consistent with the transcriptional expression patterns of TD1 and
    FON1 (CLV1 orthologues of maize and rice, respectively). Moreover, the grass
    WUS and CLV1 orthologues are coexpressed in all reproductive meristems,
    where fasciation and supernumerary floral organs occur in td1 or fon1
    loss-of-function mutants. The expression patterns of WUS orthologues in both
    grass species compared with those of dicots imply that major changes in WUS
    function, which are correlated with changes in CLV1 signaling, have occurred
    during angiosperm evolution and raise doubts about the uniqueness of the
    WUS/CLV antagonism in the maintenance of the shoot stem cell niche in
    grasses.

    From Arabidopsis full-length cDNA libraries, we collected ca. 7000 (7K)
    independent full-length cDNAs to prepare a cDNA microarray. The 7K cDNA
    collection contains 49 cytochrome P450 genes. In this study, expression
    patterns of these cytochrome P450 genes were analyzed by a full-length cDNA
    microarray under various treatments, such as hormones (salicylic acid,
    jasmonic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid), pathogen-inoculation (Alternaria
    brassicicola, Alternaria alternata), paraquat, rose bengal, UV stress
    (UV-C), heavy metal stress (CuSO4), mechanical wounding, drought, high
    salinity and low temperature. Expression of 29 cytochrome P450 genes among
    them was induced by various treatments. Inoculation with A. brassicicola and
    A. alternata as biotic stresses increased transcript levels of 12 and 5
    genes in Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In addition, some of the genes
    were also expressed by abiotic stresses. This suggests crosstalk between
    abiotic and biotic stresses. The promoter sequences and cis-acting elements
    of each gene were studied on the basis of full-length cDNA sequences. Most
    cytochrome P450 genes induced by both abiotic and biotic stresses contained
    the recognition sites of MYB and MYC, ACGT-core sequence, TGA-box and W-box
    for WRKY transcription factors in their promoters. These cis-acting elements
    are known to participate in the regulation of plant defense. The response of
    each gene to multiple stresses is strictly regulated.

    The metabolism of the chloronicotinyl insecticide imidacloprid is strongly
    influenced by the method of application. Whilst in foliar application most
    of the residues on the leaf surface display unchanged parent compound, most
    of the imidacloprid administered to plants by soil application or seed
    treatment is metabolized more or less completely, depending on plant species
    and time. The present study revealed that certain metabolites of
    imidacloprid which have been described in crop plants are highly active
    against aphid pests in different types of bioassays. Some of these
    metabolites showed a high oral activity against the green peach aphid (Myzus
    persicae), and the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii). The aphicidal potency of
    the metabolites investigated was weaker in aphid dip tests than in oral
    ingestion bioassays using artificial double membranes. The most active plant
    metabolite was the imidazoline derivative of imidacloprid. The LC50 values
    of this metabolite for M. persicae and A. gossypii in oral ingestion
    bioassays were in the lower ppb-range, i.e. 0.0044 and 0.0068 mg litre(-1),
    respectively. Most of the other reported metabolites showed much weaker
    activity. Compared to imidacloprid, the imidazoline derivative showed
    superior affinity to housefly (Musca domestica) head nicotinic acetylcholine
    receptors, while all other metabolites were less specific than imidacloprid.
    It seems possible that, after seed treatment or soil application, a few of
    the biologically active metabolites arising are acting in concert with

    BACKGROUND:Resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid in
    the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, is linked to its hydroxylation by
    constitutively overexpressed CYP6CM1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme. Here, an
    investigation was conducted to establish whether CYP6CM1 functionally
    expressed in Sf9 cells also detoxifies pymetrozine, a selective homopteran
    feeding blocker known to be cross-resistant to neonicotinoids in whiteflies.
    RESULTS:Incubation of pymetrozine with functionally expressed Bemisia
    CYP6CM1 and subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis revealed a rapid formation of two
    pymetrozine metabolites by hydroxylation of its heterocyclic 1,2,4-triazine
    ring system. Enzyme kinetics revealed a Km value of 5.9 ± 0.3 µM and a
    time-dependent depletion of pymetrozine. CONCLUSION:The known
    cross-resistance between imidacloprid, other neonicotinoid insecticides and
    pymetrozine in B. tabaci is most likely conferred by the very same
    detoxification mechanism, i.e. a monooxygenase-based hydroxylation mechanism
    linked to the overexpression of CYP6CM1. These insecticide chemistries
    should not be alternated in whitefly resistance management strategies.

  abstract: >-
    Neonicotinoid insecticides are compounds acting agonistically on insect
    nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). They are especially active on
    hemipteran pest species such as aphids, whiteflies, and planthoppers, but
    also commercialized to control many coleopteran and some lepidopteran pest
    species. The most prominent member of this class of insecticides is
    imidacloprid. All neonicotinoid insecticides bind with high affinity
    (I50-values around 1 nM) to [3H]imidacloprid binding sites on insect nAChRs.
    One notable ommission is the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, showing binding
    affinities up to 10,000-fold less potent than the others, using housefly
    head membrane preparations. Electrophysiological whole cell voltage clamp
    studies using neurons isolated from Heliothis virescens ventral nerve cord
    showed no response to thiamethoxam when applied at concentrations of 0.3 mM,
    although the symptomology of poisoning in orally and topically treated
    noctuid larvae suggested strong neurotoxicity. Other neonicotinoids, such as
    clothianidin, exhibited high activity as agonists on isolated neurons at
    concentrations as low as 30 nM. There was no obvious correlation between
    biological efficacy of thiamethoxam against aphids and lepidopterans and
    receptor affinity in electrophysiological and binding assays.
    Pharmacokinetic studies using an LC-MS/MS approach to analyze haemolymph
    samples taken from lepidopteran larvae revealed that thiamethoxam orally
    applied to 5th instar Spodoptera frugiperda larvae was rapidly metabolized
    to clothianidin, an open-chain neonicotinoid. Clothianidin shows high
    affinity to nAChRs in both binding assays and whole cell voltage clamp
    studies. When applied to cotton plants, thiamethoxam was also quickly
    metabolized, with clothianidin being the predominant neonicotinoid in planta
    briefly after application, as indicated by LC-MS/MS analyses. Interestingly,
    the N-desmethylated derivative of thiamethoxam, N-desmethyl thiamethoxam,
    was not significantly produced in either lepidopteran larvae or in cotton
    plants, although it was often mentioned as a possible metabolite, being
    nearly as active as imidacloprid. In conclusion, our investigations show
    that thiamethoxam is likely to be a neonicotinoid precursor for
    clothianidin.

    Some cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme-thiolate enzymes participate in the
    detoxication and, paradoxically, the formation of reactive intermediates of
    thousands of chemicals that can damage DNA, as well as lipids and proteins.
    CYP expression can also affect the production of molecules derived from
    arachidonic acid, and alters various downstream signal-transduction
    pathways. Such changes can be precursors to malignancy. Recent studies in
    mice have changed our perceptions about the function of CYP1 enzymes. We
    suggest a two-tiered system to predict an overall inter-individual risk of
    tumorigenesis based on DNA variants in certain 'early defence' CYP genes,
    combined with polymorphisms in various downstream target genes.

    Small-molecule hormones govern every aspect of the biology of plants. Many
    processes, such as growth, are regulated in similar ways by multiple
    hormones, and recent studies have revealed extensive crosstalk among
    different hormonal signaling pathways. These results have led to the
    proposal that a common set of signaling components may integrate inputs from
    multiple hormones to regulate growth. In this study, we tested this proposal
    by asking whether different hormones converge on a common set of
    transcriptional targets in Arabidopsis seedlings. Using publicly available
    microarray data, we analyzed the transcriptional effects of seven hormones,
    including abscisic acid, gibberellin, auxin, ethylene, cytokinin,
    brassinosteroid, and jasmonate. A high-sensitivity analysis revealed a
    surprisingly low number of common target genes. Instead, different hormones
    appear to regulate distinct members of protein families. We conclude that
    there is not a core transcriptional growth-regulatory module in young
    Arabidopsis seedlings.

    Patterning and proliferation are coordinately controlled in the development
    of Drosophila imaginal discs. Localized expression of decapentaplegic (dpp)
    at the anterior-posterior and wingless (wg) at the dorsal-ventral
    compartment boundaries controls growth of the wing with respect to the A/P
    and D/V axes. The growth-promoting effects of these organizers are thought
    to be indirect, since growth is dispersed throughout the disc, and is not
    localized near the sources of wg or dpp. wg has also been implicated in
    proximal-distal patterning of the wing hinge. In this report, we present
    evidence that wg is principally required for local cell proliferation in the
    hinge. Loss of wg expression leads to a local reduction in cell division,
    resulting in the deletion of a distinct set of wing hinge structures.
    Ectopic activation of the wg pathway in cells of the wing hinge leads to
    overproliferation without repatterning, indicating that wg acts as a mitogen
    in this part of the disc. By contrast, overexpression of wg in the wing
    blade leads to repatterning and only secondarily to proliferation. These
    results suggest that the Wg signal elicits very different responses in
    different regions of the wing imaginal disc.

    Resistance to organophosphorus (OP) insecticides is associated with
    decreased carboxylesterase activity in several insect species. It has been
    proposed that the resistance may be the result of a mutation in a
    carboxylesterase that simultaneously reduces its carboxylesterase activity
    and confers an OP hydrolase activity (the "mutant ali-esterase hypothesis").
    In the sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, the association is due to a change in
    a specific esterase isozyme, E3, which, in resistant flies, has a null
    phenotype on gels stained using standard carboxylesterase substrates. Here
    we show that an OP-resistant allele of the gene that encodes E3 differs at
    five amino acid replacement sites from a previously described OP-susceptible
    allele. Knowledge of the structure of a related enzyme
    (acetylcholinesterase) suggests that one of these substitutions (Gly137 –>
    Asp) lies within the active site of the enzyme. The occurrence of this
    substitution is completely correlated with resistance across 15 isogenic
    strains. In vitro expression of two natural and two synthetic chimeric
    alleles shows that the Asp137 substitution alone is responsible for both the
    loss of E3's carboxylesterase activity and the acquisition of a novel OP
    hydrolase activity. Modeling of Asp137 in the homologous position in
    acetylcholinesterase suggests that Asp137 may act as a base to orientate a
    water molecule in the appropriate position for hydrolysis of the
    phosphorylated enzyme intermediate.

    Two cDNA clones encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP79
    family have been isolated from Triglochin maritima. The two proteins show
    94% sequence identity and have been designated CYP79E1 and CYP79E2.
    Heterologous expression of the native and the truncated forms of the two
    clones in Escherichia coli demonstrated that both encode multifunctional
    N-hydroxylases catalyzing the conversion of tyrosine to
    p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime in the biosynthesis of the two cyanogenic
    glucosides taxiphyllin and triglochinin in T. maritima. This renders CYP79E
    functionally identical to CYP79A1 from Sorghum bicolor, and unambiguously
    demonstrates that cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in T. maritima and S.
    bicolor is catalyzed by analogous enzyme systems with
    p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime as a free intermediate. This is in contrast to
    earlier reports stipulating p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile as the only free
    intermediate in T. maritima. L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl[3-C-14]Ala (DOPA) was not
    metabolized by CYP79E1, indicating that hydroxylation of the phenol ring at
    the meta position, as required for triglochinin formation, takes place at a
    later stage. In S. bicolor, CYP71E1 catalyzes the subsequent conversion of
    p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime to p-hydroxymandelonitrile. When CYP79E1 from T.
    maritima was reconstituted with CYP71E1 and NADPH-cytochrome P450
    oxidoreductase from S. bicolor, efficient conversion of tyrosine to
    p-hydroxymandelonitrile was observed.

    Phenotypic plasticity is the primitive character state for most if not all
    traits. Insofar as developmental and physiological processes obey the laws
    of chemistry and physics, they will be sensitive to such environmental
    variables as temperature, nutrient supply, ionic environment, and the
    availability of various macro- and micronutrients. Depending on the effect
    this phenotypic plasticity has on fitness, evolution may proceed to select
    either for mechanisms that buffer or canalize the phenotype against relevant
    environmental variation or for a modified plastic response in which some
    ranges of the phenotypic variation are adaptive to particular environments.
    Phenotypic plasticity can be continuous, in which case it is called a
    reaction norm, or discontinuous, in which case it is called a polyphenism.
    Although the morphological discontinuity of some polyphenisms is produced by
    discrete developmental switches, most polyphenisms are due to
    discontinuities in the environment that induce only portions of what is in
    reality a continuous reaction norm. In insect polyphenisms, the
    environmental variable that induces the alternative phenotype is a token
    stimulus that serves as a predictor of, but is not itself, the environment
    to which the polyphenism is an adaptation. In all cases studied so far, the
    environmental stimulus alters the endocrine mechanism of metamorphosis by
    altering either the pattern of hormone secretion or the pattern of hormone
    sensitivity in different tissues. Such changes in the patterns of endocrine
    interactions result in the execution of alternative developmental pathways.
    The spatial and temporal compartmentalization of endocrine interactions has
    produced a developmental mechanism that enables substantial localized
    changes in morphology that remain well integrated into the structure and
    function of the organism.

    Metabolism of imidacloprid in the housefly Musca domestica was
    investigated.  After the injection of 14C-labeled imidacloprid,
    radioactivity decreased to approximately 20% of the initial level within 24
    hr.  Most of the 14C in the excreta as well as that in the insect body was
    accounted for by an olefin derivative of imidacloprid.  The pre-application
    of piperonyl butoxide or propargyl propyl phenylphosphonate as a synergist
    suppressed the degradation of imidacloprid and delayed the excretion of
    insecticidal components from houseflies.  These results suggested that the
    insecticidal activity of imidacloprid was affected by oxidative metabolic
    processes.

    Ovarian activity not only influences fertility, but is also involved with
    the regulation of division of labour between reproductive and behavioural
    castes of female honey bees. In order to identify candidate genes associated
    with ovarian activity, we compared the gene expression patterns between
    inactivated and activated ovaries of queens and workers by means of
    high-throughput RNA-sequencing technology. A total of 1615 differentially
    expressed genes (DEGs) was detected between ovaries of virgin and mated
    queens, and more than 5300 DEGs were detected between inactivated and
    activated worker ovaries. Intersection analysis of DEGs amongst five
    libraries revealed that a similar set of genes (824) participated in the
    ovary activation of both queens and workers. A large number of these DEGs
    were predominantly related to cellular, cell and cell part, binding,
    biological regulation and metabolic processes. In addition, over 1000 DEGs
    were linked to more than 230 components of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
    Genomes pathways, including 25 signalling pathways. The reliability of the
    RNA-sequencing results was confirmed by means of quantitative real-time PCR.
    Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in
    ovary activation and reproductive division of labour.

    Ecdysteroids mediate a wide variety of developmental and physiological
    events in insects. In the postembryonic development of insects, ecdysone is
    synthesized in the prothoracic gland (PG). Although many studies have
    revealed the biochemical and physiological properties of the enzymes for
    ecdysteroid biosynthesis, most of the molecular identities of these enzymes
    have not been elucidated. Here we describe an uncharacterized cytochrome
    P450 gene, designated Cyp306a1, that is essential for ecdysteroid
    biosynthesis in the PGs of the silkworm Bombyx mori and fruit fly Drosophila
    melanogaster. Using the microarray technique for analyzing gene expression
    profiles in PG cells during Bombyx development, we identified two
    PG-specific P450 genes whose temporal expression patterns are correlated
    with changes in ecdysteroid titer during development. Amino acid sequence
    analysis showed that one of the Bombyx P450 genes belongs to the CYP306A1
    subfamily. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the Drosophila
    Cyp306a1 homolog is essentially the same as that of Bombyx Cyp306a1. We also
    found that Drosophila Cyp306a1 is disrupted in the phantom (phm) mutant,
    known also as the Halloween mutant. The morphological defects and decreased
    expression of ecdysone-inducible genes in phm suggest that this mutant
    cannot produce a high titer of ecdysone. Finally we demonstrate that S2
    cells transfected with Cyp306a1 convert ketodiol to ketotriol via carbon 25
    hydroxylation. These results strongly suggest that CYP306A1 functions as a
    carbon 25 hydroxylase and has an essential role in ecdysteroid biosynthesis
    during insect development.

    During larval and pupal development of insects, ecdysone is synthesized in
    the prothoracic gland (PG). Although several Drosophila genes, including
    Halloween P450 genes, are known to be important for ecdysteroidogenesis in
    PG, little is known of the ecdysteroidogenic genes in other insects. Here we
    report on Cyp302a1/disembodied (dib-Bm), one of the Halloween P450s in the
    silkworm Bombyx mori that is a carbon-22 hydroxylase. dib-Bm is
    predominantly expressed in PG and its developmental expression profile is
    correlated with a change in the ecdysteroid titre in the haemolymph.
    Furthermore, dib-Bm expression in cultured PGs is significantly induced by
    treatment with prothoracicotropic hormone. This is the first report on the
    transcriptional induction of a steroidogenic gene by the tropic hormone in
    insects.

  abstract: >-
    In insects, the precise timing of molting and metamorphosis is strictly
    guided by a principal steroid hormone, ecdysone. Among the multiple
    conversion steps for synthesizing ecdysone from dietary cholesterol, the
    conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to 5 beta-ketodiol, the so-called 'Black
    Box', is thought to be the important rate-limiting step. Although a number
    of genes essential for ecdysone synthesis have recently been revealed, much
    less is known about the genes that are crucial for functioning in the Black
    Box. Here we report on a novel ecdysteroidgenic gene, non-molting glossy
    (nm-g)/shroud (sro), which encodes a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase.
    This gene was first isolated by positional cloning of the nm-g mutant of the
    silkworm Bombyx mori, which exhibits a low ecdysteroid titer and
    consequently causes a larval arrest phenotype. In the fruit fly, Drosophila
    melanogaster, the closest gene to nm-g is encoded by the sro locus, one of
    the Halloween mutant members that are characterized by embryonic ecdysone
    deficiency. The lethality of the sro mutant is rescued by the overexpression
    of either sro or nm-g genes, indicating that these two genes are
    orthologous. Both the nm-g and the sro genes are predominantly expressed in
    tissues producing ecdysone, such as the prothoracic glands and the ovaries.
    Furthermore, the phenotypes caused by the loss of function of these genes
    are restored by the application of ecdysteroids and their precursor 5
    beta-ketodiol, but not by cholesterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol. Altogether,
    we conclude that the Nm-g/Sro family protein is an essential enzyme for
    ecdysteroidogenesis working in the Black Box.

  abstract: >-
    The developmental transition from juvenile to adult is often accompanied by
    many systemic changes in morphology, metabolism, and reproduction.
    Curiously, both mammalian puberty and insect metamorphosis are triggered by
    a pulse of steroid hormones, which can harmonize gene expression profiles in
    the body and thus orchestrate drastic biological changes. However,
    understanding of how the timing of steroid hormone biosynthesis is regulated
    at the molecular level is poor. The principal insect steroid hormone,
    ecdysteroid, is biosynthesized from dietary cholesterol in the specialized
    endocrine organ called the prothoracic gland. The periodic pulses of
    ecdysteroid titers determine the timing of molting and metamorphosis. To
    date, at least nine families of ecdysteroidogenic enzyme genes have been
    identified. Expression levels of these genes correlate well with ecdysteroid
    titers, indicating that the transcriptional regulatory network plays a
    critical role in regulating the ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway. In this
    article, we summarize the transcriptional regulation of ecdysteroid
    biosynthesis. We first describe the development of prothoracic gland cells
    during Drosophila embryogenesis, and then provide an overview of the
    transcription factors that act in ecdysteroid biosynthesis and signaling. We
    also discuss the external signaling pathways that target these
    transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, we describe conserved and/or
    diverse aspects of steroid hormone biosynthesis in insect species as well as
    vertebrates.

    Gene context determines gene expression, with local chromosomal environment
    most influential. Comparative genomic analysis is often limited in scope to
    conserved or divergent gene and protein families, and fungi are well suited
    to this approach with low functional redundancy and relatively streamlined
    genomes. We show here that one aspect of gene context, the amount of
    potential upstream regulatory sequence maintained through evolution, is
    highly predictive of both molecular function and biological process in
    diverse fungi. Orthologs with large upstream intergenic regions (UIRs) are
    strongly enriched in information processing functions, such as signal
    transduction and sequence-specific DNA binding, and, in the genus
    Aspergillus, include the majority of experimentally studied, high-level
    developmental and metabolic transcriptional regulators. Many uncharacterized
    genes are also present in this class and, by implication, may be of similar
    importance. Large intergenic regions also share two novel sequence
    characteristics, currently of unknown significance: they are enriched for
    plus-strand polypyrimidine tracts and an information-rich, putative
    regulatory motif that was present in the last common ancestor of the
    Pezizomycotina. Systematic consideration of gene UIR in comparative
    genomics, particularly for poorly characterized species, could help reveal
    organisms' regulatory priorities.

  abstract: >-
    This chapter describes parthenogenesis, a phenomenon found in some insects
    by which offspring can develop from an egg alone without sperm.
    Parthenogenetic reproduction requires a mechanism to circumvent the normal
    halving of ploidy that results from gametogenesis. In insects, many
    mechanisms for the preservation or restoration of diploidy have evolved.
    Either meiosis is eliminated (apomixis) or diploidy is restored (automixis)
    during or after meiosis. Apomixis and some forms of automixis result in
    maintenance of heterozygosity, whereas other forms of automixis result in
    instant homozygosity. Far from being a reproductive curiosity,
    parthenogenesis has arisen in most insect groups, and many parthenogenetic
    species are both abundant and widespread. Many economically important pests
    of agriculture and horticulture are parthenogenetic. Thelytokous and
    pseudogamous taxa are so ecologically successful that one cannot simply view
    them as reproductive aberrations. The success of parthenogenetic lineages
    poses something of a paradox. Either genetic variation in nature is less
    important than we sometimes assume, or parthenogenetic lineages are more
    genetically diverse than one suppose. The study of parthenogenesis can
    illuminate one of the central problems in biology, that of explaining the
    ubiquity of sex and recombination, and the adaptive significance of the laws
    of genetics, by revealing when and where in nature the laws of genetics are
    suspended or overthrown. Insects and mites, because of their short life
    cycles and often large population numbers, are ideal organisms for studying
    the evolutionary and ecological consequences of parthenogenesis.

  abstract: >-
    Genetic redundancy means that two or more genes are performing the same
    function and that inactivation of one of these genes has little or no effect
    on the biological phenotype. Redundancy seems to be widespread in genomes of
    higher organisms(1-9). Examples of apparently redundant genes come from
    numerous studies of developmental biology(10-15), immunology(16,17),
    neurobiology(18,19) and the cell cycle(20,21). Yet there is a problem: genes
    encoding functional proteins must be under selection pressure, If a gene was
    truly redundant then it would not be protected against the accumulation of
    deleterious mutations. A widespread view is therefore that such redundancy
    cannot be evolutionarily stable. Here we develop a simple genetic model to
    analyse selection pressures acting on redundant genes. We present four cases
    that can explain why genetic redundancy is common, In three cases,
    redundancy is even evolutionarily stable. Our theory provides a framework
    for exploring the evolution of genetic organization.

  abstract: >-
    The evolution of organismal diversity among the Metazoa is dependent on the
    proliferation of genes and diversification of functions in multigene
    families. Here we analyse these processes for one highly successful family,
    the carboxyl/ cholinesterases. One key to the expansion of the functional
    niche of this group of enzymes is associated with versatile substrate
    binding and catalytic machinery. Qualitatively new functions can be obtained
    by substitution of one or a very few amino acids. This crudely adapted new
    functionality is then refined rapidly by a pulse of change elsewhere in the
    molecule; in one case about 13% amino acid divergence occurred in 5-10
    million years. Furthermore, we postulate that the versatility of the
    substrate binding motifs underpins the recruitment of several family members
    to additional noncatalytic signal transduction functions. BioEssays

    In most lineages of the subgenus Sophophora esterase-6 is a homodimeric
    haemolymph protein. In the melanogaster subgroup of species it has become a
    monomer which is mainly expressed in the male sperm ejaculatory duct. Our
    analyses of esterase-6 sequences from three melanogaster subgroup species
    and two close relatives reveal a brief period of accelerated amino acid
    sequence change during the transition between the ancestral and derived
    states. In this period of 2-6Myr the ratio of replacement to silent site
    substitutions (0.51) is about three times higher than the values in other
    lineages of the phylogeny. There are about 50 more replacements in this
    period than would be predicted from the ratios of replacement to silent site
    substitutions found elsewhere in the phylogeny. Modelling on the known
    structure of a related acetylcholinesterase suggests that an unusually high
    proportion of the replacements in the transitional branch are
    non-conservative changes on the protein surface. Up to half the accelerated
    replacement rate can be accounted for by clusters of changes to the face of
    the molecule containing the opening of the active site gorge. This includes
    changes in and around regions homologous to peripheral substrate binding
    sites in acetylcholinesterase. There are also three changes in glycosylation
    status. One region predicted to lie on the protein surface which becomes
    markedly more hydrophilic is proposed to be the ancestral dimerisation site
    that is lost in the transitional branch.

    The numbers of glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P450 and esterase genes
    in the genome of the hymenopteran parasitoid Nasonia vitripennis are about
    twice those found in the genome of another hymenopteran, the honeybee Apis
    mellifera. Some of the difference is associated with clades of these
    families implicated in xenobiotic resistance in other insects and some is in
    clades implicated in hormone and pheromone metabolism. The data support the
    hypothesis that the eusocial behaviour of the honeybee and the concomitant
    homeostasis of the nest environment may obviate the need for as many
    gene/enzyme systems associated with xenobiotic metabolism as are found in
    other species, including N. vitripennis, that are thought to encounter a
    wider range of potentially toxic xenobiotics in their diet and habitat.

    temperature. However, the hydrogen-bonding pattern in the heme pocket of
    these mutants is essentially similar for that of the WT enzyme. This
    suggests that the determination of the structure of the NADH complex of
    P450nor is required, in order to evaluate the role of Thr243 in its
    enzymatic reaction. We attempted to crystallize the NADH complex under
    several conditions, but have not yet been successful. (C) 2000 Elsevier

    The Inparanoid eukaryotic ortholog database (http://inparanoid.cgb.ki.se/)
    is a collection of pairwise ortholog groups between 17 whole genomes;
    Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis elegans,
    Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Gallus gallus, Homo
    sapiens, Mus musculus, Pan troglodytes, Rattus norvegicus, Oryza sativa,
    Plasmodium falciparum, Arabidopsis thaliana, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Complete proteomes for these
    genomes were derived from Ensembl and UniProt and compared pairwise using
    Blast, followed by a clustering step using the Inparanoid program. An
    Inparanoid cluster is seeded by a reciprocally best-matching ortholog pair,
    around which inparalogs (should they exist) are gathered independently,
    while outparalogs are excluded. The ortholog clusters can be searched on the
    website using Ensembl gene/protein or UniProt identifiers, annotation text
    or by Blast alignment against our protein datasets. The entire dataset can
    be downloaded, as can the Inparanoid program itself.

    Preference determines behavioral choices such as choosing among food sources
    and mates. One preference-affecting chemical is ethanol, which guides
    insects to fermenting fruits or leaves. Here, we show that adult Drosophila
    melanogaster prefer food containing up to 5% ethanol over food without
    ethanol and avoid food with high levels (23%) of ethanol. Although female
    and male flies behaved differently at ethanol-containing food sources, there
    was no sexual dimorphism in the preference for food containing modest
    ethanol levels. We also investigated whether Drosophila preference,
    sensitivity and tolerance to ethanol was related to the activity of alcohol
    dehydrogenase (Adh), the primary ethanol-metabolizing enzyme in D.
    melanogaster. Impaired Adh function reduced ethanol preference in both D.
    melanogaster and a related species, D. sechellia. Adh-impaired flies also
    displayed reduced aversion to high ethanol concentrations, increased
    sensitivity to the effects of ethanol on postural control, and negative
    tolerance/sensitization (i.e., a reduction of the increased resistance to
    ethanol's effects that normally occurs upon repeated exposure). These data
    strongly indicate a linkage between ethanol-induced behavior and ethanol
    metabolism in adult fruit flies: Adh deficiency resulted in reduced
    preference to low ethanol concentrations and reduced aversion to high ones,
    despite recovery from ethanol being strongly impaired.

    Floral organ identity and meristem determinacy in plants are controlled by
    combinations of activities mediated by MADS box genes. AGAMOUS-LIKE6
    (AGL6)-like genes are MADS box genes expressed in floral tissues, but their
    biological functions are mostly unknown. Here, we describe an AGL6-like gene
    in rice (Oryza sativa), MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1 (MFO1/MADS6), that regulates
    floral organ identity and floral meristem determinacy. In the flower of mfo1
    mutants, the identities of palea and lodicule are disturbed, and mosaic
    organs were observed. Furthermore, the determinacy of the floral meristem
    was lost, and extra carpels or spikelets developed in mfo1 florets. The
    expression patterns of floral MADS box genes were disturbed in the mutant
    florets. Suppression of another rice AGL6-like gene, MADS17, caused no
    morphological abnormalities in the wild-type background, but it enhanced the
    phenotype in the mfo1 background, indicating that MADS17 has a minor but
    redundant function with that of MFO1. Whereas single mutants in either MFO1
    or the SEPALLATA-like gene LHS1 showed moderate phenotypes, the mfo1 lhs1
    double mutant showed a severe phenotype, including the loss of spikelet
    meristem determinacy. We propose that rice AGL6-like genes help to control
    floral organ identity and the establishment and determinacy of the floral
    meristem redundantly with LHS1.

    With the completion of the rice genome sequencing, a standardized annotation
    is necessary so that the information from the genome sequence can be fully
    utilized in understanding the biology of rice and other cereal crops. An
    annotation jamboree was held in Japan with the aim of annotating and
    manually curating all the genes in the rice genome. Here we present the Rice
    Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB), which has been developed to provide
    access to the annotation data. The RAP-DB has two different types of
    annotation viewers, BLAST and BLAT search, and other useful features. By
    connecting the annotations to other rice genomics data, such as full-length
    cDNAs and Tos17 mutant lines, the RAP-DB serves as a hub for rice genomics.
    All of the resources can be accessed through http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/.

  abstract: >-
    Axillary meristem (AM) formation is an important determinant of plant
    architecture. In rice (Oryza sativa), LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) function is
    required for the generation of AM throughout the plant's lifespan. Here, we
    show a close relationship between AM initiation and leaf development;
    specifically, the plastochron 4 (P4) stage of leaf development is crucial
    for the proliferation of meristematic cells. Coincident with this, LAX1
    expression starts in the axils of leaves at P4 stage. LAX1 mRNA accumulates
    in two to three layers of cells in the boundary region between the
    initiating AM and the shoot apical meristem. In lax1 mutants, the
    proliferation of meristematic cells is initiated but fails to progress into
    the formation of AM. The difference in sites of LAX1 mRNA expression and its
    action suggests non-cell-autonomous characteristics of LAX1 function. We
    found that LAX1 protein is trafficked to AM in a stage- and
    direction-specific manner. Furthermore, we present evidence that LAX1
    protein movement is required for the full function of LAX1. Thus, we propose
    that LAX1 protein accumulates transiently in the initiating AM at P4 stage
    by a strict regulation of mRNA expression and a subsequent control of
    protein trafficking. This two-step regulation is crucial to the
    establishment of the new AM.

  abstract: >-
    The haplodiploid system of sex determination of Hymenoptera acts as an
    exaptation for species to evolve novel forms of asexual reproduction
    including thelytoky (clonal offspring of the mother). During normal
    reproduction in Hymenoptera, three of the four products of meiosis that are
    present in newly-laid eggs are lost as polar bodies, while the remaining
    pronucleus either develops as a haploid male or fuses with a sperm nucleus
    to produce a diploid zygote. In contrast, in thelytokous reproduction, which
    is uncommon but taxonomically widespread, two of the four products of
    meiosis fuse, as if one acted as a sperm. Queenless workers of Apis
    mellifera capensis, a subspecies of honey bee from South Africa, routinely
    reproduce thelytokously. Unmated A. m. capensis queens can also be induced
    to lay thelytokously by narcosis with carbon dioxide, but mated queens are
    never thelytokous. We artificially inseminated A. m. capensis queens using
    CO2 narcosis. Up to 1/3 of offspring workers carried two maternal alleles
    and an allele of one father whereas no three-allele progeny were seen in
    control queens of the arrhenotokous (unfertilized eggs result in males)
    subspecies A. m. scutellata. Flow cytometry of three-allele individuals
    revealed that they were triploid and arose from the fertilization of a
    thelytokous fusion nucleus. We then reared six queens from a narcotized A.
    m. capensis queen and determined the ploidy of the offspring queens based on
    microsatellites. One of the five daughters was triploid. Following
    artificial insemination, this queen produced unfertilized thelytokous
    diploid eggs at high frequency, and unfertilized triploid eggs at much lower
    frequency. If fertilized, thelytokous diploid eggs were non-viable, even
    though triploidy in itself does not impede normal development. In contrast,
    when the rarer triploid eggs were fertilized, a proportion developed into
    viable tetraploids. Our study highlights the extraordinary developmental
    flexibility of haplo-diploid systems.

  abstract: >-
    Studies in model organisms have identified regulatory processes that
    profoundly influence aging, many of which modulate resistance against
    environmental or metabolic stresses. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the
    transcription regulator SKN-1 is important for oxidative stress resistance
    and acts in multiple longevity pathways. SKN-1 is the ortholog of mammalian
    Nrf proteins, which induce Phase 2 detoxification genes in response to
    stress. Phase 2 enzymes defend against oxygen radicals and conjugate
    electrophiles that are produced by Phase 1 detoxification enzymes, which
    metabolize lipophilic compounds. Here, we have used expression profiling to
    identify genes and processes that are regulated by SKN-1 under normal and
    stress-response conditions. Under nonstressed conditions SKN-1 upregulates
    numerous genes involved in detoxification, cellular repair, and other
    functions, and downregulates a set of genes that reduce stress resistance
    and lifespan. Many of these genes appear to be direct SKN-1 targets, based
    upon presence of predicted SKN-binding sites in their promoters. The
    metalloid sodium arsenite induces skn-1-dependent activation of certain
    detoxification gene groups, including some that were not SKN-1-upregulated
    under normal conditions. An organic peroxide also triggers induction of a
    discrete Phase 2 gene set, but additionally stimulates a broad
    SKN-1-independent response. We conclude that under normal conditions SKN-1
    has a wide range of functions in detoxification and other processes,
    including modulating mechanisms that reduce lifespan. In response to stress,
    SKN-1 and other regulators tailor transcription programs to meet the
    challenge at hand. Our findings reveal striking complexity in SKN-1
    functions and the regulation of systemic detoxification defenses.

    Cytochrome P450 enzyme system consists of P450 and its NAD(P)H-linked
    reductase or reducing system, and catalyses monooxygenation reactions. The
    most prevalent type in eukaryotic organisms is 'microsomes type', which
    consists of membrane-bound P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase. The second type is
    'mitochondria type', in which P450 is bound to the inner membrane while the
    reducing system consisting of an NADPH-linked flavoprotein and a
    ferredoxin-type iron-sulphur protein is soluble in the matrix space. The
    third type is 'bacteria type', in which both P450 and the reducing system
    are soluble in the cytoplasm. In addition to these three types, several
    forms of P450-reductase fusion proteins have been found in prokaryotic
    organisms. On the other hand, some P450s catalyse the re-arrangement of the
    oxygen atoms in the substrate molecules that does not require the supply of
    reducing equivalents for the reaction. A peculiar P450, P450nor, receives
    electrons directly from NADH for the reduction of nitric oxide.

    There exist a variety of factors that negatively impact the health and
    survival of managed honey bee colonies, including the spread of parasites
    and pathogens, loss of habitat, reduced availability or quality of food
    resources, climate change, poor queen quality, changing cultural and
    commercial beekeeping practices, as well as exposure to agricultural and
    apicultural pesticides both in the field and in the hive. These factors are
    often closely intertwined, and it is unlikely that a single stressor is
    driving colony losses. There is a growing consensus, however, that
    increasing prevalence of parasites and pathogens are among the most
    significant threats to managed bee colonies. Unfortunately, improper
    management of hives by beekeepers may exacerbate parasite populations and
    disease transmission. Furthermore, research continues to accumulate that
    describes the complex and largely harmful interactions that exist between
    pesticide exposure and bee immunity. This brief review summarizes our
    progress in understanding the impact of pesticide exposure on bees at the
    individual, colony, and community level.

    Bacterial endosymbionts of insects have long been implicated in the
    phenomenon of cytoplasmic incompatibility, in which certain crosses between
    symbiont-infected individuals lead to embryonic death or sex ratio
    distortion. The taxonomic position of these bacteria has, however, not been
    known with any certainty. Similarly, the relatedness of the bacteria
    infecting various insect hosts has been unclear. The inability to grow these
    bacteria on defined cell-free medium has been the major factor underlying
    these uncertainties. We circumvented this problem by selective PCR
    amplification and subsequent sequencing of the symbiont 16S rRNA genes
    directly from infected insect tissue. Maximum parsimony analysis of these
    sequences indicates that the symbionts belong in the alpha-subdivision of
    the Proteobacteria, where they are most closely related to the Rickettsia
    and their relatives. They are all closely related to each other and are
    assigned to the type species Wolbachia pipientis. Lack of congruence between
    the phylogeny of the symbionts and their insect hosts suggest that
    horizontal transfer of symbionts between insect species may occur.
    Comparison of the sequences for W. pipientis and for Wolbachia persica, an
    endosymbiont of ticks, shows that the genus Wolbachia is polyphyletic. A PCR
    assay based on 16S primers was designed for the detection of W. pipientis in
    insect tissue, and initial screening of insects indicates that cytoplasmic
    incompatibility may be a more general phenomenon in insects than is
    currently recognized.

    The swallowtail butterfly, Papilio xuthus L., feeds exclusively on members
    of the plant family, Rutaceae. Female butterflies lay eggs in response to
    specific chemicals contained in their host plants. They perceive a variety
    of polar compounds as oviposition stimulants through the tarsal
    chemosensilla of the foreleg by drumming upon the leaf surface. We undertook
    an expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis to identify the
    chemosensory-related genes that are expressed in chemosehsilla on the tarsus
    of P. xuthus. Several genes that showed similarity with biotransformation
    enzymes were identified from the ESTs. Among them, a cytochrome P450 and a
    glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were preferentially expressed in the
    chemosensory organs. We have determined the structure of both cDNA and
    genomic sequences encoding these enzymes and designated the P450 as
    CYP341A2, a novel member of CYP341A subfamily, and the GST as GST-pxcs1,
    respectively. We observed a localized expression of CYP341A2 at the base of
    tarsal chemosensilla by in situ hybridization. These results suggest that
    these degrading enzymes play a role in the chemosensory reception for host
    plant recognition. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    Ecdysteroids regulate many key developmental events in arthropods including
    molting and metamorphosis. Recently, members of the Drosophila Halloween
    group of genes, that are required for embryonic viability and cuticle
    deposition, have been shown to code for several cytochrome P450 enzymes that
    catalyze the terminal hydroxylation steps in the conversion of cholesterol
    to the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. These P450s are conserved in
    other insects and each is thought to function throughout development as the
    sole mediator of a particular biosynthetic step since, where analyzed, each
    is expressed at all stages of development and shows no closely related
    homolog in their respective genomes. In contrast, we show here that several
    dipteran genomes encode two novel, highly related, microsomal P450 enzymes,
    Cyp307A1 and Cyp307A2, that likely participate as stage-specific components
    of the ecdysone biosynthetic machinery. This hypothesis comes from the
    observation that Cyp307A1 is encoded by the Halloween gene spook (spo), but
    unlike other Halloween class genes, Dmspo is not expressed during the larval
    stages. In contrast, Cyp307a2, dubbed spookier (spok), is expressed
    primarily during larval stages within the prothoracic gland cells of the
    ring gland. RNAi mediated reduction in the expression of this
    heterochromatin localized gene leads to arrest at the first instar stage
    which can be rescued by feeding the larva 20E, E or ketodiol but not 7dC. In
    addition, spok expression is eliminated in larvae carrying mutations in
    molting defective (mld), a gene encoding a nuclear zinc finger protein that
    is required for production of ecdysone during Drosophila larval development.
    Intriguingly, mld is not present in the Bombyx mori genome, and we have
    identified only one spook homolog in both Bombyx and Manduca that is
    expressed in both embryos and larva. These studies suggest an evolutionary
    split between Diptera and Lepidoptera in how the ecdysone biosynthetic
    pathway is regulated during development.

    We present here the first curated collection of wild and cultivated African
    rice species. For that, we designed specific SNPs and were able to structure
    these very low diverse species. Oryza glaberrima, the cultivated African
    rice, is endemic from Africa. This species and its direct ancestor, O.
    barthii, are valuable tool for improvement of Asian rice O. sativa in terms
    of abiotic and biotic stress resistance. However, only a few limited studies
    about the genetic diversity of these species were performed. In the present
    paper, and for the first time at such extend, we genotyped 279 O.
    glaberrima, selected both for their impact in current breeding and for their
    geographical distribution, and 101 O. barthii, chosen based on their
    geographic origin, using a set of 235 SNPs specifically designed for African
    rice diversity. Using those data, we were able to structure the individuals
    from our sample in three populations for O. barthii, related to geography,
    and two populations in O. glaberrima; these two last populations cannot be
    linked however to any currently phenotyped trait. Moreover, we were also
    able to identify misclassification in O. glaberrima as well as in O. barthii
    and identified new form of O. sativa from the set of African varieties.

    Here we study hybridization, introgression and lineage diversification in
    the widely distributed canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and the relict
    island oak (Q. tomentella), two Californian golden cup oaks with an
    intriguing biogeographical history. We employed restriction-site-associated
    DNA sequencing and integrated phylogenomic and population genomic analyses
    to study hybridization and reconstruct the evolutionary past of these taxa.
    Our analyses revealed the presence of two cryptic lineages within Q.
    chrysolepis. One of these lineages shares its most recent common ancestor
    with Q. tomentella, supporting the paraphyly of Q. chrysolepis. The split of
    these lineages was estimated to take place during the late Pliocene or the
    early Pleistocene, a time corresponding well with the common presence of Q.
    tomentella in the fossil records of continental California. Analyses also
    revealed historical hybridization among lineages, high introgression from Q.
    tomentella into Q. chrysolepis in their current area of sympatry, and
    widespread admixture between the two lineages of Q. chrysolepis in contact
    zones. Our results support that the two lineages of Q. chrysolepis behave as
    a single functional species phenotypically and ecologically well
    differentiated from Q. tomentella, a situation that can be only accommodated
    considering hybridization and speciation as a continuum with diffuse limits.

    The InParanoid project gathers proteomes of completely sequenced eukaryotic
    species plus Escherichia coli and calculates pairwise ortholog relationships
    among them. The new release 7.0 of the database has grown by an order of
    magnitude over the previous version and now includes 100 species and their
    collective 1.3 million proteins organized into 42.7 million pairwise
    ortholog groups. The InParanoid algorithm itself has been revised and is now
    both more specific and sensitive. Based on results from our recent
    benchmarking of low-complexity filters in homology assignment, a two-pass
    BLAST approach was developed that makes use of high-precision compositional
    score matrix adjustment, but avoids the alignment truncation that sometimes
    follows. We have also updated the InParanoid web site
    (http://InParanoid.sbc.su.se). Several features have been added, the
    response times have been improved and the site now sports a new, clearer
    look. As the number of ortholog databases has grown, it has become difficult
    to compare among these resources due to a lack of standardized source data
    and incompatible representations of ortholog relationships. To facilitate
    data exchange and comparisons among ortholog databases, we have developed
    and are making available two XML schemas: SeqXML for the input sequences and
    OrthoXML for the output ortholog clusters.

  abstract: >-
    Creating artificial protein families affords new opportunities to explore
    the determinants of structure and biological function free from many of the
    constraints of natural selection. We have created an artificial family
    comprising similar to 3,000 P450 heme proteins that correctly fold and
    incorporate a heme cofactor by recombining three cytochromes P450 at seven
    crossover locations chosen to minimize structural disruption. Members of
    this protein family differ from any known sequence at an average of 72 and
    by as many as 109 amino acids. Most (> 73%) of the properly folded chimeric
    P450 heme proteins are catalytically active peroxygenases; some are more
    thermostable than the parent proteins. A multiple sequence alignment of 955
    chimeras, including both folded and not, is a valuable resource for
    sequence-structure-function studies. Logistic regression analysis of the
    multiple sequence alignment identifies key structural contributions to
    cytochrome P450 heme incorporation and peroxygenase activity and suggests
    possible structural differences between parents CY1P102A1 and CYP102A2.

  abstract: >-
    While the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is indirectly responsible for the
    initiation of all above-ground postembryonic organs, in most plants the vast
    majority of these organs are directly initiated by lateral meristems. In
    Arabidopsis thaliana, the lateral meristems include flower meristems (FMs),
    which form on the flanks of the SAM, and lateral shoot meristems (LSMs),
    which develop in leaf axils. While significant progress has been made on the
    molecular genetic basis of SAM initiation during embryo development,
    relatively little is known about the initiation of meristems at lateral
    positions. Here we have characterized the phenotypic consequences and
    genetic interactions of mutations in the REVOLUTA (REV) gene, with an
    emphasis on the role of REV in lateral meristem initiation. Our observations
    indicate that REV is required for initiation of both LSMs and FMs, and
    likely acts in the same pathway as, and upstream of, known meristem
    regulators. We identified the REV gene and found it encodes a predicted
    homeodomain/leucine zipper transcription factor that also contains a START
    sterol-lipid binding domain. REV is the same as the IFL gene. REV was
    expressed at the earliest stages of LSM and FM formation. Within the
    inflorescence shoot meristem, REV expression appeared to predict 3–5
    incipient flower primordia on the flanks of the SAM, and REV expression at
    stage 1 and stage 2 matched that of WUS and STM, respectively. We propose
    that REV acts at lateral positions to activate the expression of known
    meristem regulators.

    Sequencing technology and assembly algorithms have matured to the point that

    Current assemblies traverse transposable elements (TEs) and provide an

    annotation of each class of TEs, but their relative performances have not

    to produce a non-redundant library of TEs for species lacking this resource
    to generate whole-genome TE annotations.

  abstract: >-
    Insect metamorphosis is one of the most fascinating biological processes in
    the animal kingdom. The dramatic transition from an immature juvenile to a
    reproductive adult is under the control of the steroid hormone ecdysone,
    also known as the insect molting hormone. During Drosophila development,
    periodic pulses of ecdysone are released from the prothoracic glands, upon
    which the hormone is rapidly converted in peripheral tissues to its
    biologically active form, 20-hydroxyecdysone. Each hormone pulse has a
    unique profile and causes different developmental events, but we only have a
    rudimentary understanding of how the timing, amplitude, and duration of a
    given pulse are controlled. A key component involved in the timing of
    ecdysone pulses is PTTH, a brain-derived neuropeptide. PTTH stimulates
    ecdysone production through a Ras/Raf/ERK signaling cascade; however,
    comparatively little is known about the downstream targets of this pathway.
    In recent years, it has become apparent that transcriptional regulation
    plays a critical role in regulating the synthesis of ecdysone, but only one
    transcription factor has a well-defined link to PTTH. Interestingly, many of
    the ecdysteroidogenic transcription factors were originally characterized as
    primary response genes in the ecdysone signaling cascade that elicits the
    biological responses to the hormone in target tissues. To review these
    developments, we will first provide an overview of the transcription factors
    that act in the Drosophila ecdysone regulatory hierarchy. We will then
    discuss the roles of these transcriptional regulators in controlling
    ecdysone synthesis. In the last section, we will briefly outline
    transcription factors that likely have roles in regulating ecdysone
    synthesis but have not been formally identified as downstream effectors of
    ecdysone.

    In a number of higher plants, a substantial portion of the genome is
    composed of repetitive sequences that can hinder genome annotation and
    sequencing efforts. To better understand the nature of repetitive sequences
    in plants and provide a resource for identifying such sequences, we
    constructed databases of repetitive sequences for 12 plant genera:
    Arabidopsis, Brassica, Glycine, Hordeum, Lotus, Lycopersicon, Medicago,
    Oryza, Solanum, Sorghum, Triticum and Zea (www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/plant.
    repeats/index.shtml). The repetitive sequences within each database have
    been coded into super-classes, classes and sub-classes based on sequence and
    structure similarity. These databases are available for sequence similarity
    searches as well as downloadable files either as entire databases or subsets
    of each database. To further the utility for comparative studies and to
    provide a resource for searching for repetitive sequences in other genera
    within these families, repetitive sequences have been combined into four
    databases to represent the Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Gramineae and Solanaceae
    families. Collectively, these databases provide a resource for the
    identification, classification and analysis of repetitive sequences in
    plants.

    In The Institute for Genomic Research Rice Genome Annotation project
    (http://rice.tigr.org), we have continued to update the rice genome sequence
    with new data and improve the quality of the annotation. In our current
    release of annotation (Release 4.0; January 12, 2006), we have identified
    42,653 non-transposable element-related genes encoding 49,472 gene models as
    a result of the detection of alternative splicing. We have refined our
    identification methods for transposable element-related genes resulting in
    13,237 genes that are related to transposable elements. Through
    incorporation of multiple transcript and proteomic expression data sets, we
    have been able to annotate 24 799 genes (31,739 gene models), representing
    approximately 50% of the total gene models, as expressed in the rice genome.
    All structural and functional annotation is viewable through our Rice Genome
    Browser which currently supports 59 tracks. Enhanced data access is
    available through web interfaces, FTP downloads and a Data Extractor tool
    developed in order to support discrete dataset downloads.

  abstract: >-
    Nutritional conditions during early development influence the plastic
    expression of adult phenotypes. Among several body modules of animals, the
    development of sexually selected exaggerated traits exhibits striking
    nutrition sensitivity, resulting in positive allometry and hypervariability
    distinct from other traits. Using de novo RNA sequencing and comprehensive
    RNA interference (RNAi) for epigenetic modifying factors, we found that
    histone deacetylases (HDACs) and polycomb group (PcG) proteins
    preferentially influence the size of mandibles (exaggerated male weapon) and
    demonstrate nutrition-dependent hypervariability in the broad-horned flour
    beetle, Gnatocerus cornutus. RNAi-mediated HDAC1 knockdown (KD) in G.
    cornutus larvae caused specific curtailment of mandibles in adults, whereas
    HDAC3 KD led to hypertrophy. Notably, these KDs conferred opposite effects
    on wing size, but little effect on the size of the core body and genital
    modules. PcG RNAi also reduced adult mandible size. These results suggest
    that the plastic development of exaggerated traits is controlled in a
    module-specific manner by HDACs.

    <h2>Summary</h2><p>The separation of germline from somatic lineages is
    fundamental to reproduction and species preservation. Here, we show that
    *Drosophila* Germ cell-less (GCL) is a critical component in this process by
    acting as a switch that turns off a somatic lineage pathway. GCL, a
    conserved BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac) protein, is a
    substrate-specific adaptor for Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex
    (CRL3^GCL^). We show that CRL3^GCL^ promotes PGC fate by mediating
    degradation of Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and major determinant
    of somatic cell fate. This mode of RTK degradation does not depend upon
    receptor activation but is prompted by release of GCL from the nuclear
    envelope during mitosis. The cell-cycle-dependent change in GCL localization
    provides spatiotemporal specificity for RTK degradation and sequesters
    CRL3^GCL^ to prevent it from participating in excessive activities. This
    precisely orchestrated mechanism of CRL3^GCL^ function and regulation
    defines cell fate at the single-cell level.</p>

    run genomic analyses or interpret their results. FINDINGS:We present BamBam,
    a package of tools for genome sequence analysis. BamBam contains tools that
    facilitate summarizing data from BAM alignment files and identifying
    features such as SNPs, indels, and haplotypes represented in those
    alignments. CONCLUSIONS:BamBam provides a powerful and convenient framework
    to analyze genome sequence data contained in BAM files.

  abstract: >-
    Plants with altered microRNA metabolism have pleiotropic developmental
    defects, but direct evidence for microRNAs regulating specific aspects of
    plant morphogenesis has been lacking. In a genetic screen, we identified the
    JAW locus, which produces a microRNA that can guide messenger RNA cleavage
    of several TCP genes controlling leaf development. MicroRNA-guided cleavage
    of TCP4 mRNA is necessary to prevent aberrant activity of the TCP4 gene
    expressed from its native promoter. In addition, overexpression of wild-type
    and microRNA-resistant TCP variants demonstrates that mRNA cleavage is
    largely sufficient to restrict TCP function to its normal domain of
    activity. TCP genes with microRNA target sequences are found in a wide range
    of species, indicating that microRNA-mediated control of leaf morphogenesis
    is conserved in plants with very different leaf forms.

  abstract: >-
    The ability to assimilate C and allocate non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs)
    to the most appropriate organs is crucial to maximize plant ecological or
    agronomic performance. Such C source and sink activities are differentially
    affected by environmental constraints. Under drought, plant growth is
    generally more sink than source limited as organ expansion or appearance
    rate is earlier and stronger affected than C assimilation. This favors plant
    survival and recovery but not always agronomic performance as NSC are stored
    rather than used for growth due to a modified metabolism in source and sink
    leaves. Such interactions between plant C and water balance are complex and
    plant modeling can help analyzing their impact on plant phenotype. This
    paper addresses the impact of trade-offs between C sink and source
    activities and plant production under drought, combining experimental and
    modeling approaches. Two contrasted monocotyledonous species (rice, oil
    palm) were studied. Experimentally, the sink limitation of plant growth
    under moderate drought was confirmed as well as the modifications in NSC
    metabolism in source and sink organs. Under severe stress, when C source
    became limiting, plant NSC concentration decreased. Two plant models
    dedicated to oil palm and rice morphogenesis were used to perform a
    sensitivity analysis and further explore how to optimize C sink and source
    drought sensitivity to maximize plant growth. Modeling results highlighted
    that optimal drought sensitivity depends both on drought type and species
    and that modeling is a great opportunity to analyze such complex processes.
    Further modeling needs and more generally the challenge of using models to
    support complex trait breeding are discussed.

    We observed unusual kinds of rearrangements within tandemly clustered 5S
    genes internal to a P element in dysgenic context. Rearranged P transposons,
    initially containing eight 5S genes, were found to display discrete numbers
    of 5S genes, from 4 up to 17 units. Precise deletions and amplifications
    occurred at a high rate (40%), at both original and new insertion sites.
    These events can be explained by a 'cut and paste' transposition model.
    Possible links between rearrangements due to dysgenic-like processes and
    concerted evolution are discussed.

    * Restriction site-Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) has become a widely
    adopted method for genotyping populations of model and non-model organisms.
    Generating a reliable set of loci for downstream analysis requires
    appropriate use of bioinformatics software, such as the program stacks.



    * Using three empirical RAD-seq datasets, we demonstrate a method for
    optimising a de novo assembly of loci using stacks. By iterating values of
    the program's main parameters and plotting resultant core metrics for
    visualisation, researchers can gain a much better understanding of their
    dataset and select an optimal set of parameters; we present the 80% rule as
    a generally effective method to select the core parameters for stacks.



    * Visualisation of the metrics plotted for the three RAD-seq datasets shows
    that they differ in the optimal parameters that should be used to maximise
    the amount of available biological information. We also demonstrate that
    building loci de novo and then integrating alignment positions is more
    effective than aligning raw reads directly to a reference genome.



    * Our methods will help the community in honing the analytical skills
    necessary to accurately assemble a RAD-seq dataset.

  abstract: >-
    Humans and other mammals actively discriminate among the Various forms of
    vitamin IS to selectively retain a-tocopherol, but the phylogenetic breadth
    of this trait is unknown. We sought to determine if the fruit fly,
    Drosophila melanogaster, similarly discriminates and if so by what
    mechanism. Larvae and adult flies fed diets containing predominantly gamma-
    and delta-tocopherols were enriched in alpha-tocopherol. Inclusion in the
    diet of piperonyl butoxide (PBO). an insect cytochrome P-450 inhibitor and
    inhibitor of tocopherol-omega-hydroxylase activity, greatly elevated tissue
    levels of delta-tocopherol but not alpha-tocopherol. Drosophila microsomes
    exhibited tocopherol-omega-hydroxylase activity in the order of delta-T >
    gamma-T >> alpha-T, a pattern consistent with the effect of PBO in vivo. To
    determine if selectivity involved alpha-tocopherol transfer protein
    (alpha-TTP), adult flies were fed an equimolar mixture of d(3)-RRR- and
    d(6)-all-racemic alpha-tocopherol. Flies exhibited a d(3)/d(6), ratio of
    1.03, demonstrating an inability to discriminate on the basis of phytyl tail
    stereochemistry, a hallmark of alpha-TTP, activity. We conclude that
    Drosophila preferentially accumulates alpha-tocopherol via a mechanism
    involving cytochrome P-450 tocopherol-omega-hydroxylase-mediated catabolism
    of other tocopherols, but not a mammalian-like alpha-TTP. The selective
    pressure favoring this trait and its remarkable conservation from insects to
    humans requires elucidation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

    Reactive oxygen (RO) has been identified as an important effector in ageing
    and lifespan determination(1-3). The specific cell types, however, in which
    oxidative damage acts to limit lifespan of the whole organism have not been
    explicitly identified. The association between mutations in the gene
    encoding the oxygen radical metabolizing enzyme CuZn superoxide dismutase
    (SOD1) and loss of motorneurons in the brain and spinal cord that occurs in
    the life-shortening paralytic disease, Familial Amyotrophic Lateral
    Sclerosis (FALS; ref. 4), suggests that chronic and unrepaired oxidative
    damage occurring specifically in motor neurons could be a critical causative
    factor in ageing. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic
    Drosophila which express human SOD1 specifically in adult motorneurons. We
    show that overexpression of a single gene, SOD1, in a single cell type, the
    motorneuron, extends normal lifespan by up to 40% and rescues the lifespan
    of a short-lived Sod null mutant. Elevated resistance to oxidative stress
    suggests that the lifespan extension observed in these flies is due to
    enhanced RO metabolism. These results show that SOD activity in motorneurons
    is an important factor in ageing and lifespan determination in Drosophila.

  abstract: >-
    Flower production and crop yields are highly influenced by the architectures
    of inflorescences. In the compound inflorescences of tomato and related
    nightshades (Solanaceae), new lateral inflorescence branches develop on the
    flanks of older branches that have terminated in flowers through a program
    of plant growth known as "sympodial." Variability in the number and
    organization of sympodial branches produces a remarkable array of
    inflorescence architectures, but little is known about the mechanisms
    underlying sympodial growth and branching diversity. One hypothesis is that
    the rate of termination modulates branching. By performing deep sequencing
    of transcriptomes, we have captured gene expression dynamics from individual
    shoot meristems in tomato as they gradually transition from a vegetative
    state to a terminal flower. Surprisingly, we find thousands of age-dependent
    expression changes, even when there is little change in meristem morphology.
    From these data, we reveal that meristem maturation is an extremely gradual
    process defined molecularly by a "meristem maturation clock." Using hundreds
    of stage-enriched marker genes that compose this clock, we show that extreme
    branching, conditioned by loss of expression of the COMPOUND INFLORESCENCE
    gene, is driven by delaying the maturation of both apical and lateral
    meristems. In contrast, we find that wild tomato species display a delayed
    maturation only in apical meristems, which leads to modest branching. Our
    systems genetics approach reveals that the program for inflorescence
    branching is initiated surprisingly early during meristem maturation and
    that evolutionary diversity in inflorescence architecture is modulated by
    heterochronic shifts in the acquisition of floral fate.

    In fruit fly research, chromosomal deletions are indispensable tools for
    mapping mutations, characterizing alleles and identifying interacting loci.
    Most widely used deletions were generated by irradiation or chemical
    mutagenesis. These methods are labor-intensive, generate random breakpoints
    and result in unwanted secondary mutations that can confound phenotypic
    analyses. Most of the existing deletions are large, have molecularly
    undefined endpoints and are maintained in genetically complex stocks.
    Furthermore, the existence of haplolethal or haplosterile loci makes the
    recovery of deletions of certain regions exceedingly difficult by
    traditional methods, resulting in gaps in coverage. Here we describe two
    methods that address these problems by providing for the systematic
    isolation of targeted deletions in the D. melanogaster genome. The first
    strategy used a P element based technique to generate deletions that closely
    flank haploinsufficient genes and minimize undeleted regions. This deletion
    set has increased overall genomic coverage by 5-7%. The second strategy used
    FLP recombinase and the large array of FRT-bearing insertions described in
    the accompanying paper(1) to generate 519 isogenic deletions with
    molecularly defined endpoints. This second deletion collection provides 56%
    genome coverage so far. The latter methodology enables the generation of
    small custom deletions with predictable endpoints throughout the genome and
    should make their isolation a simple and routine task.

    Mutations in single genes and environmental interventions can extend healthy
    lifespan in laboratory model organisms. Some of the mechanisms involved show
    evolutionary conservation, opening the way to using simpler invertebrates to
    understand human ageing. Forkhead transcription factors have been found to
    play a key role in lifespan extension by alterations in the insulin/IGF
    pathway and by dietary restriction. Interventions that extend lifespan have
    also been found to delay or ameliorate the impact of ageing-related
    pathology and disease, including cancer. Understanding the mode of action of
    forkheads in this context will illuminate the mechanisms by which ageing
    acts as a risk factor for ageing-related disease, and could lead to the
    development of a broad-spectrum, preventative medicine for the diseases of
    ageing.

    This annual review focuses on invertebrate model organisms, which continue
    to yield fundamental new insights into mechanisms of aging. This year, the
    budding yeast has been used to understand how asymmetrical partitioning of
    cellular constituents at cell division can produce a rejuvenated offspring
    from an aging parent. Blocking of sensation of carbon dioxide is shown to
    extend fly lifespan and to mediate the lifespan-shortening effect of sensory
    exposure to fermenting yeast. A new study of daf-16, the key forkhead
    transcription factor that mediates extension of lifespan by mutants in the
    insulin-signalling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrates that
    expression of tissue-specific isoforms with different patterns of response
    to upstream signalling mediates the highly pleiotropic effects of the
    pathway on lifespan and other traits. A new approach to manipulating
    mitochondrial activity in Drosophila, by introducing the yeast
    NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, shows promise for understanding the role of
    mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in aging. An exciting new study of
    yeast and mammalian cells implicates deterioration of the nuclear pore, and
    consequent leakage of cytoplasmic components into the nucleus, as an
    important cause of aging in postmitotic tissues. Loss of, or damage to,
    chromosome-associated histones is also implicated in the determination of
    lifespan in yeast, worms and fruit flies. The relationship between
    functional aging, susceptibility to aging-related disease and lifespan
    itself are explored in two studies in C. elegans, the first examining the
    role of dietary restriction and reduced insulin signalling in cognitive
    decline and the second profiling aggregation of the proteome during aging.
    The invertebrates continue to be a power house of discovery for future work
    in mammals.

    A major advance in modern evolutionary biology is the ability to start
    linking phenotypic evolution in the wild with genomic changes that underlie
    that evolution. We capitalized on a rapidly evolving Hawaiian population of
    crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to test hypotheses about the genomic
    consequences of a recent Mendelian mutation of large effect which disrupts
    the development of sound-producing structures on male forewings. The
    resulting silent phenotype, flatwing, persists because of natural selection
    imposed by an acoustically orienting parasitoid, but it interferes with mate
    attraction. We examined gene expression differences in developing wing buds
    of wild-type and flatwing male crickets using RNA-seq and quantitative
    proteomics. Most differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were
    down-regulated in flatwing males (625 up vs. 1716 down), whereas up- and
    down-regulated proteins were equally represented (30 up and 34 down).
    Differences between morphs were clearly not restricted to a single pathway,
    and we recovered annotations associated with a broad array of functions that
    would not be predicted a priori. Using a candidate gene detection test based
    on homology, we identified 30% of putative Drosophila wing development genes
    in the cricket transcriptome, but only 10% were DE. In addition to
    wing-related annotations, endocrine pathways and several biological
    processes such as reproduction, immunity and locomotion were DE in the
    mutant crickets at both biological levels. Our results illuminate the
    breadth of genetic pathways that are potentially affected in the early
    stages of adaptation.

  abstract: >-
    RNA-sequencing is a popular next-generation sequencing technique for
    assaying genome-wide gene expression profiles. Nonetheless, it is
    susceptible to biases that are introduced by sample handling prior gene
    expression measurements. Two of the most common methods for preserving
    samples in both field-based and laboratory conditions are submersion in
    RNAlater and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Flash freezing in liquid
    nitrogen can be impractical, particularly for field collections. RNAlater is
    a solution for stabilizing tissue for longer-term storage as it rapidly
    permeates tissue to protect cellular RNA. In this study, we assessed
    genome-wide expression patterns in 30 day old fry collected from the same
    brood at the same time point that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
    stored at -80°C or submerged and stored in RNAlater at room temperature,
    simulating conditions of fieldwork. We show that sample storage is a
    significant factor influencing observed differential gene expression. In
    particular, genes with elevated GC content exhibit higher observed
    expression levels in liquid nitrogen flash-freezing relative to
    RNAlater-storage. Further, genes with higher expression in RNAlater relative
    to liquid nitrogen experience disproportionate enrichment for functional
    categories, many of which are involved in RNA processing. This suggests that
    RNAlater may elicit a physiological response that has the potential to bias
    biological interpretations of expression studies. The biases introduced to
    observed gene expression arising from mimicking many field-based studies are
    substantial and should not be ignored.

    The tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta is an important model for insect
    physiology but genomic and transcriptomic data are currently lacking.
    Following a recent pyrosequencing study generating immune related expressed
    sequence tags (ESTs), here we use this new technology to define the M. sexta
    larval midgut transcriptome. We generated over 387,000 midgut ESTs, using a
    combination of Sanger and 454 sequencing, and classified predicted proteins
    into those involved in digestion, detoxification and immunity. In many cases
    the depth of 454 pyrosequencing coverage allowed us to define the entire
    cDNA sequence of a particular gene. Many new M. sexta genes are described
    including up to 36 new cytochrome P450s, some of which have been implicated
    in the metabolism of host plant-derived nicotine. New lepidopteran gene
    families such as the beta-fructofuranosidases, previously thought to be
    restricted to Bombyx mori, are also described. An unexpectedly high number
    of ESTs were involved in immunity, for example 39 contigs encoding serpins,
    and the increasingly appreciated role of the midgut in insect immunity is
    discussed. Similar studies of other tissues will allow for a tissue by
    tissue description of the M. sexta transcriptome and will form an essential
    complimentary step on the road to genome sequencing and annotation.

    Although satellite DNAs are well-explored components of heterochromatin and
    centromeres, little is known about emergence, dispersal and possible impact
    of comparably structured tandem repeats (TRs) on the genome-wide scale. Our
    bioinformatics analysis of assembled Tribolium castaneum genome disclosed
    significant contribution of TRs in euchromatic chromosomal arms and clear
    predominance of satellite DNA-typical 170 bp monomers in arrays of ≥5
    repeats. By applying different experimental approaches, we revealed that the
    nine most prominent TR families Cast1–Cast9 extracted from the assembly
    comprise ∼4.3% of the entire genome and reside almost exclusively in
    euchromatic regions. Among them, seven families that build ∼3.9% of the
    genome are based on ∼170 and ∼340 bp long monomers. Results of phylogenetic
    analyses of 2500 monomers originating from these families show high-sequence
    dynamics, evident by extensive exchanges between arrays on non-homologous
    chromosomes. In addition, our analysis shows that concerted evolution acts
    more efficiently on longer than on shorter arrays. Efficient genome-wide
    distribution of nine TR families implies the role of transposition only in
    expansion of the most dispersed family, and involvement of other mechanisms
    is anticipated. Despite similarities in sequence features, FISH experiments
    indicate high-level compartmentalization of centromeric and euchromatic
    tandem repeats.

    Caloric restriction (CR) is the most potent intervention known to both
    protect against carcinogenesis and extend lifespan in laboratory animals. A
    variety of anticarcinogens and CR mimetics induce and activate the
    NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2, in turn, induces a number of
    antioxidative and carcinogendetoxifying enzymes. Thus, Nrf2 offers a
    promising target for anticarcinogenesis and antiaging interventions. We used
    Nrf2-disrupted (KO) mice to examine its role on the biological effects of
    CR. Here, we show that Nrf2 is responsible for most of the anticarcinogenic
    effects of CR, but is dispensable for increased insulin sensitivity and
    lifespan extension. Nrf2-deficient mice developed tumors more readily in
    response to carcinogen exposure than did WT mice, and CR was ineffective in
    suppressing tumors in the KO mice. However, CR extended lifespan and
    increased insulin sensitivity similarly in KO and WT mice. These findings
    identify a molecular pathway that dissociates the prolongevity and
    anticarcinogenic effects of CR.

    The interaction of adrenodoxin (Adx) and NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase
    (CPR) with human microsomal steroidogenic cytochrome P450s was studied. It
    is found that Adx, mitochondrial electron transfer protein, is able to
    support reactions catalyzed by human microsomal P450s: full length CYP17,
    truncated CYP17, and truncated CYP21. CPR, but not Adx, supports activity of
    truncated CYP19. Truncated and the full length CYP17s show distinct
    preference for electron donor proteins. Truncated CYP17 has higher activity
    with Adx compared to CPR. The alteration in preference to electron donor
    does not change product profile for truncated enzymes. The electrostatic
    contacts play a major role in the interaction of truncated CYP17 with either
    CPR or Adx. Similarly electrostatic contacts are predominant in the
    interaction of full length CYP17 with Adx. We speculate that Adx might serve
    as an alternative electron donor for CYP17 at the conditions of CPR
    deficiency in human. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

    Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) is an epigenetic mechanism that
    suppresses the activity of repetitive DNA elements via accumulation of
    repressive chromatin marks. We discuss natural variation in TGS, with a
    particular focus on cases that affect the function of protein-coding genes
    and lead to developmental or physiological changes. Comparison of the
    examples described has revealed that most natural variation is associated
    with genetic determinants, such as gene rearrangements, inverted repeats,
    and transposon insertions that triggered TGS. Recent technical advances have
    enabled the study of epigenetic natural variation at a whole-genome scale
    and revealed patterns of inter- and intraspecific epigenetic variation.
    Future studies exploring non-model species may reveal species-specific
    evolutionary adaptations at the level of chromatin configuration.

    Genome-wide microarray analysis (Affymetrix array) was used (1) to determine
    whether only one gene, the cytochrome P450 enzyme Cyp6g1, is differentially
    transcribed in dichlorocliphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)-resistant vs.
    -susceptible Drosophila; and (it) to profile common genes differentially
    transcribed across a DDT-resistant field isolate \[Rst(2)DDTWisconsin] and a
    laboratory DDT-selected population \[Rst(2)DDT91-R]. Statistical analysis
    (ANOVA model) identified 158 probe sets that were differentially transcribed
    among Rst(2)DDT91-R, Rst(2)DDTWisconsin, and the DDT-susceptible genotype
    Canton-S (P < 0.01). The cytochrome P450 Cyp6a2 and the diazepam-binding
    inhibitor gene (Dbi) were over transcribed in the two DDT-resistant
    genotypes when compared to the wild-type Drosophila, and this difference was
    significant at the most stringent statistical level, a Bonferroni
    correction. The list of potential candidates differentially transcribed also
    includes 63 probe sets for which molecular function ontology annotation of
    the probe sets did not exist. A total of four genes (Cyp6a2, Dbi, Uhg1, and
    CG11176) were significantly different (P < 5.6 e(-06)) between Rst(2)DDT91-R
    and Canton-S. Additionally, two probe sets encoding Cyp12d1 and Dbi were
    significantly different between Rst(2)DDTWisconsin and Canton-S after a
    Bonferroni correction. Fifty-two probe sets, including those associated with
    pesticide detoxification, ion transport, signal transduction, RNA
    transcription, and lipid metabolism, were commonly expressed in both
    resistant lines but were differentially transcribed in Canton-S. Our results
    suggest that more than Cyp6g1 is overtranscribed in field and laboratory
    DDT-resistant genotypes, and the number of commonalities suggests that
    similar resistance mechanisms may exist between laboratory- and
    field-selected DDT-resistant fly lines.

    To study how changes in gene regulation shape phenotypic variations in rice,
    we performed a comparative analysis of genome expression in the
    heading-stage panicle from six lineages of cultivated and wild rice,
    including Oryza sativa subsp. indica, japonica and javanica, O. nivara , O.
    rufipogon and O. glaberrima. While nearly three-quarters of the genes are
    expressed at a constant level in all six lineages, a large portion of the
    genome, ranging from 1767 to 4489 genes, exhibited differential expression
    between Asian domesticated and wild rice with repression or down-regulation
    of genome expression in Asian cultivated rice as the dominant trend.
    Importantly, we found this repression was achieved to a large extent by the
    differential expression of a single member of paralogous gene families.
    Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that
    genes related to catabolism are repressed while genes related to anabolism
    up-regulated. Finally, we observed that distinct evolutionary forces may
    have acted on gene expression and the coding sequences in the examined rice
    lineages.

    The impact of projected global warming on crop yields has been evaluated by
    indirect methods using simulation models. Direct studies on the effects of
    observed climate change on crop growth and yield could provide more accurate
    information for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production.
    We analyzed weather data at the International Rice Research Institute Farm
    from 1979 to 2003 to examine temperature trends and the relationship between
    rice yield and temperature by using data from irrigated field experiments
    conducted at the International Rice Research Institute Farm from 1992 to
    2003. Here we report that annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures have
    increased by 0.35 degrees C and 1.13 degrees C, respectively, for the period
    1979-2003 and a close linkage between rice grain yield and mean minimum
    temperature during the dry cropping season (January to April). Grain yield
    declined by 10% for each 1 degrees C increase in growing-season minimum
    temperature in the dry season, whereas the effect of maximum temperature on
    crop yield was insignificant. This report provides a direct evidence of
    decreased rice yields from increased nighttime temperature associated with
    global warming.

    Single-cell RNA-seq data contain a large proportion of zeros for expressed
    genes. Such dropout events present a fundamental challenge for various types
    of data analyses. Here, we describe the SCRABBLE algorithm to address this
    problem. SCRABBLE leverages bulk data as a constraint and reduces unwanted
    bias towards expressed genes during imputation. Using both simulation and
    several types of experimental data, we demonstrate that SCRABBLE outperforms
    the existing methods in recovering dropout events, capturing true
    distribution of gene expression across cells, and preserving gene-gene
    relationship and cell-cell relationship in the data.

    billion years of evolution of gene regulatory networks. For each gene
    family, a basic description is provided that is complemented by literature
    references, and multiple sequence alignments of protein domains. TF or TR
    gene entries include information of expressed sequence tags, 3D protein
    structures of homologous proteins, domain architecture and cross-links to
    other computational resources online. Moreover, the different species in
    PlnTFDB are linked to each other by means of orthologous genes facilitating

  abstract: >-
    In Arabidopsis thaliana, multiple genes involved in shoot apical meristem
    (SAM) transitions have been characterized, but the mechanisms required for
    the dynamic attainment of vegetative, inflorescence, and floral meristem
    (VM, IM, FM) cell fates during SAM transitions are not well understood. Here
    we show that a MADS-box gene, XAANTAL2 (XAL2/AGL14), is necessary and
    sufficient to induce flowering, and its regulation is important in FM
    maintenance and determinacy. xal2 mutants are late flowering, particularly
    under short-day (SD) condition, while XAL2 overexpressing plants are early
    flowering, but their flowers have vegetative traits. Interestingly,
    inflorescences of the latter plants have higher expression levels of LFY,
    AP1, and TFL1 than wild-type plants. In addition we found that XAL2 is able
    to bind the TFL1 regulatory regions. On the other hand, the basipetal
    carpels of the 35S::XAL2 lines lose determinacy and maintain high levels of
    WUS expression under SD condition. To provide a mechanistic explanation for
    the complex roles of XAL2 in SAM transitions and the apparently paradoxical
    phenotypes of XAL2 and other MADS-box (SOC1, AGL24) overexpressors, we
    conducted dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN) and epigenetic landscape
    modeling. We uncovered a GRN module that underlies VM, IM, and FM gene
    configurations and transition patterns in wild-type plants as well as loss
    and gain of function lines characterized here and previously. Our approach
    thus provides a novel mechanistic framework for understanding the complex
    basis of SAM development.

  abstract: >-
    Tomato is a major crop plant and several mutants have been selected for
    breeding but also for isolating important genes that regulate flowering and
    sympodial growth. Besides, current research in developmental biology aims at
    revealing mechanisms that account for diversity in inflorescence
    architectures. We therefore found timely to review the current knowledge of
    the genetic control of flowering in tomato and to integrate the emerging
    network into modeling attempts. We developed a kinetic model of the tomato
    inflorescence development where each meristem was represented by its
    "vegetativeness" (V), reflecting its maturation state toward flower
    initiation. The model followed simple rules: maturation proceeded
    continuously at the same rate in every meristem (dV); floral transition and
    floral commitment occurred at threshold levels of V; lateral meristems were
    initiated with a gain of V (ΔV) relative to the V level of the meristem from
    which they derived. This last rule created a link between successive
    meristems and gave to the model its zigzag shape. We next exploited the
    model to explore the diversity of morphotypes that could be generated by
    varying dV and ΔV and matched them with existing mutant phenotypes. This
    approach, focused on the development of the primary inflorescence, allowed
    us to elaborate on the genetic regulation of the kinetic model of
    inflorescence development. We propose that the lateral inflorescence
    meristem fate in tomato is more similar to an immature flower meristem than
    to the inflorescence meristem of Arabidopsis. In the last part of our paper,
    we extend our thought to spatial regulators that should be integrated in a
    next step for unraveling the relationships between the different meristems
    that participate to sympodial growth.

    Stored product insects feed on grains and processed commodities manufactured
    from grain post-harvest, reducing the nutritional value and contaminating
    food. Currently, the main defense against stored product insect pests is the
    pesticide fumigant phosphine. Phosphine is highly toxic to all animals, but
    is the most effective and economical control method, and thus is used
    extensively worldwide. However, many insect populations have become
    resistant to phosphine, in some cases to very high levels. New,
    environmentally benign and more effective control strategies are needed for
    stored product pests. RNA interference (RNAi) may overcome pesticide
    resistance by targeting the expression of genes that contribute to
    resistance in insects. Most data on RNAi in stored product insects is from
    the coleopteran genetic model, Tribolium castaneum, since it has a strong
    RNAi response via injection of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) in any life
    stage. Additionally, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
    Repeats (CRISPR) technology has been suggested as a potential resource for
    new pest control strategies. In this review we discuss background
    information on both gene disruption technologies and summarize the advances
    made in terms of molecular pest management in stored product insects, mainly
    T. castaneum, as well as complications and future needs.

    Measuring gene transcription using real-time reverse transcription
    polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technology is a mainstay of molecular
    biology. Technologies now exist to measure the abundance of many transcripts
    in parallel. The selection of the optimal reference gene for the
    normalisation of this data is a recurring problem, and several algorithms
    have been developed in order to solve it. So far nothing in R exists to
    unite these methods, together with other functions to read in and normalise
    the data using the chosen reference gene(s).

  abstract: "Identifying insecticide resistance mechanisms is paramount for pest insect control, as the understandings that underpin insect control strategies must provide ways of detecting and managing resistance. Insecticide resistance studies rely heavily on detailed biochemical and genetic analyses. Although there have been many successes, there are also many examples of resistance that still challenge us. As a precursor to rational pest insect control, the biology of the insect, within the contexts of insecticide modes of action and insecticide metabolism, must be well understood. It makes sense to initiate this research in the best model insect system, Drosophila melanogaster, and translate these findings and methodologies to other insects. Here we explore the usefulness of the D.\_melanogaster model in studying metabolic-based insecticide resistances, target-site mediated resistances and identifying novel insecticide targets, whilst highlighting the importance of having a more complete understanding of insect biology for insecticide studies."

    A null mutation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit Dab,
    in Drosophila melanogaster, confers 1181-fold resistance to a new and
    increasingly important biopesticide, spinosad. This study's molecular
    characterisation of a spinosad resistance mechanism identifies Do:6 as a
    major spinosad target in D. melanogaster. Although D. melanogaster is not a
    major field pest, target site resistances found in this species are often
    conserved in pest species. This, combined with the high degree of
    evolutionary conservation of nAChR subunits, suggests that mutations in Dab
    orthologues may underpin the spinosad resistance identified in several
    economically important field pests. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract: >-
    Several strains of Drosophila melanogaster possess mutant alleles in
    nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, Dα1 and Dβ2 that confer
    resistance to neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid and nitenpyram, and Dα6,
    that confers resistance to spinosyns. These mutant strains were bioassayed
    with a selected set of nAChR active insecticides including neonicotinoids,
    spinosad, and sulfoxaflor, a new sulfoximine insecticide. All of the
    neonicotinoids examined, except dinotefuran showed reduced insecticidal
    efficacy on larvae of the Dα1 mutant, suggesting that this subunit may be
    important in the action of these insecticides. All of the neonicotinoids,
    including dinotefuran, showed reduced insecticidal efficacy on larvae
    possessing the Dβ2 mutation. A similar pattern of broad neonicotinoid
    resistance to that of Dβ2 alone was also observed for larvae with both the
    mutations (Dα1+Dβ2). The Dβ2 mutation exhibited a lower level of
    cross-resistance to sulfoxaflor (<3-fold) than to any of the neonicotinoids
    (>13-fold). In contrast, there was no cross-resistance for any of the
    neonicotinoids or sulfoxaflor in adult flies with the Dα6 mutation, which
    confers high levels of resistance to spinosad. Thus in the D. melanogaster
    strains studied, target site resistance observed for the neonicotinoids and
    the spinosyns does not translate directly to resistance towards sulfoxaflor.

  abstract: >-
    Resistance to insecticides by modification of their molecular targets is a
    serious problem in chemical control of many arthropod pests. Neonicotinoids
    target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) of arthropods. The
    spectrum of possible resistance-conferring mutations of this receptor is
    poorly understood. Prediction of resistance is complicated by the existence
    of multiple genes encoding the different subunits of this essential
    component of neurotransmission. We focused on the cluster of three
    Drosophila melanogaster nAChR subunit genes at cytological region 96A. EMS
    mutagenesis and selection for resistance to nitenpyram was performed on
    hybrids carrying a deficiency for this chromosomal region. Two
    complementation groups were defined for the four strains isolated. Molecular
    characterisation of the mutations found lesions in two nAChR subunit genes,
    Dα1 (encoding an α-type subunit) and Dβ2 (β-type). Mutations conferring
    resistance in β-type receptors have not previously been reported, but we
    found several lesions in the Dβ2 sequence, including locations distant from
    the predicted neonicotinoid-binding site. This study illustrates that
    mutations in a single-receptor subunit can confer nitenpyram resistance.
    Moreover, some of the mutations may protect the insect against nitenpyram by
    interfering with subunit assembly or channel activation, rather than
    affecting binding affinities of neonicotinoids to the channel.

    High-throughput sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) has become the standard method
    for measuring and comparing the levels of gene expression in a wide variety
    of species and conditions. RNA-seq experiments generate very large, complex
    data sets that demand fast, accurate and flexible software to reduce the raw
    read data to comprehensible results. HISAT (hierarchical indexing for
    spliced alignment of transcripts), StringTie and Ballgown are free,
    open-source software tools for comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq
    experiments. Together, they allow scientists to align reads to a genome,
    assemble transcripts including novel splice variants, compute the abundance
    of these transcripts in each sample and compare experiments to identify
    differentially expressed genes and transcripts. This protocol describes all
    the steps necessary to process a large set of raw sequencing reads and
    create lists of gene transcripts, expression levels, and differentially
    expressed genes and transcripts. The protocol's execution time depends on
    the computing resources, but it typically takes under 45 min of computer
    time. HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown are available from
    http://ccb.jhu.edu/software.shtml.

  abstract: >-
    The exon-1 peptide of huntingtin has 51 Gln repeats and produces the
    symptoms of Huntington's disease in transgenic mice. Aggregation of the
    yeast Sup35 protein into prions has been attributed to its glutamine-rich
    and asparagine-rich domain. Here, we show that poly-l-asparagine forms polar
    zippers similar to those of poly-l-glutamine. In solution at acid pH, the
    glutamine-rich and asparagine-rich 18-residue Sup35 peptide, rendered
    soluble by the addition of two aspartates at the amino end and two lysines
    at the carboxyl end, gives a β-sheet CD spectrum; it aggregates at neutral
    pH. A poly-alanine peptide D2A10K2 gives an α-helical CD spectrum at all pHs
    and does not aggregate; a peptide with the sequence of the C-terminal helix
    of the α-chain of human hemoglobin, preceded by two aspartates and followed
    by two lysines, exhibits a random coil spectrum and does not aggregate
    either. Alignment of several β-strands with the sequence of the 42-residue
    Alzheimer's amyloid β-peptide shows that they can be linked together by a
    network of salt bridges. We also asked why single amino acid replacements
    can so destabilize the native structures of proteins that they unfold and
    form amyloids. The difference in free energy of a protein molecule between
    its native, fully ordered structure and an amorphous mixture of randomly
    coiled chains is only of the order of 10 kcal/mol. Theory shows that
    destabilization of the native structure by no more than 2 kcal/mol can
    increase the probability of nucleation of disordered aggregates from which
    amyloids could grow 130,000-fold.

    The CYP6B1 and CYP6B3 cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in the midgut of the
    black swallowtail participate in the metabolism of toxic furanocoumarins
    present in its host plants. In this study, biochemical analyses indicate
    that the fat body metabolizes significant amounts of the linear
    furanocoumarins bergapten and xanthotoxin after larvae feed on xanthotoxin.
    Northern analyses of the combined CYP6B1/3 transcript expression patterns
    indicate that transcripts in this P450 subfamily are induced in the midgut
    and fat body by xanthotoxin. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses of individual
    CYP6B1/CYP6B3 mRNAs indicate that CYP6B1 transcripts are induced by
    xanthotoxin in all tissues examined and that CYP6B3 transcripts are induced
    in the fat body only. These results indicate that the fat body participates
    in the P450-mediated metabolism of excess furanocoumarins unmetabolized by
    the midgut. Although transcripts of both genes were detected and CYP6B1
    transcripts were induced by xanthotoxin in the integument, furanocoumarin
    metabolism was not detected. Comparison of these P450 promoters with the
    promoters of alcohol dehydrogenase genes expressed in the fat bodies of
    several Drosophila species suggest that the xanthotoxin inducibilities of
    these P450 genes in fat bodies are regulated by elements other than those
    modulating expression of Adh genes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

  abstract: >-
    Papilio polyxenes, a lepidopteran continually exposed to toxic
    furanocoumarins in its hostplants, owes its tolerance to these compounds to
    the transcriptional induction of the CYP6B1 gene encoding a P450 capable of
    metabolizing linear furanocoumarins, such as xanthotoxin, at high rates.
    Transient expression of various lengths of wild-type and mutant CYP6Blv3
    promoter in lepidopteran Sf9 cells defines a positive element (XRE-xan) from
    - 136 to - 119 required for both basal and xanthotoxin-inducible
    transcription and a negative element from - 228 to - 146 that represses
    basal transcription. Fusion of the CYP6Blv3 XRE-xan element to the
    Drosophila melanogaster Eip28/29 core promoter indicates that the XRE-xan
    functions in conjunction with its own core promoter but not with a
    heterologous core promoter. Sequence searches of the CYP6B1v3 proximal
    promoter region revealed a number of putative elements (XRE-AhR, ARE, OCT-1,
    EcRE, C/ EBP, Inr) sharing sequence similarity with those in other regulated
    vertebrate and insect promoters. Mutation of TGAC nucleotides shared by the
    overlapping EcRE/ARE/XRE-xan indicates that this sequence is essential for
    basal and regulated transcription of this gene. Mutagenesis in the
    non-overlapping region of the EcRE indicates it modulates basal
    transcription. These findings are incorporated into a working model for
    regulation of this toxin-inducible promoter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract: "Summary\nHymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees) are one of four mega-diverse insect orders, comprising more than 153,000 described and possibly up to one million undescribed extant species [1, 2]. As parasitoids, predators, and pollinators, Hymenoptera play a fundamental role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and are of substantial economic importance [1, 3]. To understand the diversification and key\_evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life, we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species. Our analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started to diversify around 281 million years ago (mya). The primarily ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be monophyletic. The species-rich lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a monophyletic group as well. The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are identified as the sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we located the evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family “Crabronidae.” Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the result of a previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous Hymenoptera that did not lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They also confirm that all primarily parasitoid wasps are descendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived around 247 mya. Our findings provide the basis for a natural classification of Hymenoptera and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera, including their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life styles."

    Cytochromes P450 comprise a very large superfamily of hemeproteins which
    generally monooxygenate hydrophobic compounds. P450s appear to have a common
    conserved structural core, yet are variable in regions involved in substrate
    recognition and binding, and in redox-partner binding. These differences can
    be identified by an analysis in which structural alignments and homology
    models are used to compare the various classes and families of P450s.

  abstract: >-
    The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone
    technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical
    diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of
    ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost
    genotyping has been largely achieved via “SNP chip” microarray-based
    platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence
    and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted
    variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment
    bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific
    variants, a major source of information for both population history and
    genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in
    reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel
    sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct
    sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and
    procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption.
    Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom
    combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate
    genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a
    range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no
    prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below
    that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time
    investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times
    on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the
    application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in
    wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach
    promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide
    range of organisms.

  abstract: >-
    The steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is the primary regulatory hormone that
    mediates developmental transitions in insects and other arthropods. 20E is
    produced from ecdysone (E) by the action of a P450 monooxygenase that
    hydroxylates E at carbon 20. The gene coding for this key enzyme of
    ecdysteroidogenesis has not been identified definitively in any insect. We
    show here that the Drosophila E-20-monooxygenase (E20MO) is the product of
    the shade (shd) locus (cytochrome p450, CYP314a1). When shd is transfected
    into Drosophila S2 cells, extensive conversion of E to 20E is observed,
    whereas in sorted homozygous shd embryos, no E20MO activity is apparent
    either in vivo or in vitro. Mutations in shd lead to severe disruptions in
    late embryonic morphogenesis and exhibit phenotypes identical to those seen
    in disembodied (dib) and shadow (sad) mutants, two other genes of the
    Halloween class that code for P450 enzymes that catalyze the final two steps
    in the synthesis of E from 2,22-dideoxyecdysone. Unlike dib and sad, shd is
    not expressed in the ring gland but is expressed in peripheral tissues such
    as the epidermis, midgut, Malpighian tubules, and fat body, i.e., tissues
    known to be major sites of E20MO activity in a variety of insects. However,
    the tissue in which shd is expressed does not appear to be important for
    developmental function because misexpression of shd in the embryonic
    mesoderm instead of the epidermis, the normal embryonic tissue in which shd
    is expressed, rescues embryonic lethality.

    Despite the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) being famous for its
    adaptations to the defensive traits of its milkweed host plants, little is
    known about the macroevolution of these traits. Unlike most other animal
    species, monarchs are largely insensitive to cardenolides, because their
    target site, the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase), has evolved amino acid
    substitutions that reduce cardenolide binding (so-called target site
    insensitivity, TSI). Because many, but not all, species of milkweed
    butterflies (Danaini) are associated with cardenolide-containing host
    plants, we analyzed 16 species, representing all phylogenetic lineages of
    milkweed butterflies, for the occurrence of TSI by sequence analyses of the
    Na+/K+-ATPase gene and by enzymatic assays with extracted Na+/K+-ATPase.
    Here we report that sensitivity to cardenolides was reduced in a stepwise
    manner during the macroevolution of milkweed butterflies. Strikingly, not
    all Danaini typically consuming cardenolides showed TSI, but rather TSI was
    more strongly associated with sequestration of toxic cardenolides. Thus, the
    interplay between bottom-up selection by plant compounds and top-down
    selection by natural enemies can explain the evolutionary sequence of
    adaptations to these toxins.

    Association studies can focus on candidate gene(s), a particular genomic
    region, or adopt a genome-wide association approach, each of which has
    implications for marker selection. The strategy for marker selection will
    affect the statistical power of the study to detect a disease association
    and is a crucial element of study design. The abundant single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) are the markers of choice in genetic case-control
    association studies. The genotypes of neighboring SNPs are often highly
    correlated ('in linkage disequilibrium', LD) within a population, which is
    utilized for selecting specific 'tagSNPs' to serve as proxies for other
    nearby SNPs in high LD. General guidelines for SNP selection in candidate
    genes/regions and genome-wide studies are provided in this protocol, along
    with illustrative examples. Publicly available web-based resources are
    utilized to browse and retrieve data, and software, such as Haploview and
    Goldsurfer2, is applied to investigate LD and to select tagSNPs.

    In the development of the Drosophila embryo, gene expression is directed by
    the sequence-specific interactions of a large network of protein
    transcription factors (TFs) and DNA cis-regulatory binding sites. Once the
    identity of the typically 8–10bp binding sites for any given TF has been
    determined by one of several experimental procedures, the sequences can be
    represented in a position weight matrix (PWM) and used to predict the
    location of additional TF binding sites elsewhere in the genome. Often,
    alignments of large (>200bp) genomic fragments that have been experimentally
    determined to bind the TF of interest in Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
    (ChIP) studies are trimmed under the assumption that the majority of the
    binding sites are located near the center of all the aligned fragments. In
    this study, ChIP/chip datasets are analyzed using the corresponding PWMs for
    the well-studied TFs; CAUDAL, HUNCHBACK, KNIRPS and KRUPPEL, to determine
    the distribution of predicted binding sites. All four TFs are critical
    regulators of gene expression along the anterio-posterior axis in early
    Drosophila development. For all four TFs, the ChIP peaks contain multiple
    binding sites that are broadly distributed across the genomic region
    represented by the peak, regardless of the prediction stringency criteria
    used. This result suggests that ChIP peak trimming may exclude functional
    binding sites from subsequent analyses.

    A central goal of evolutionary biology is to identify the genes and
    evolutionary forces that cause speciation, the emergence of reproductive
    isolation between populations. Despite the identification of several genes
    that cause hybrid sterility or inviability-many of which have evolved
    rapidly under positive Darwinian selection-little is known about the
    ecological or genomic forces that drive the evolution of postzygotic
    isolation. Here, we show that the same gene, Overdrive, causes both male
    sterility and segregation distortion in F-1 hybrids between the Bogota and
    U. S. subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura. This segregation distorter
    gene is essential for hybrid sterility, a strong reproductive barrier
    between these young taxa. Our results suggest that genetic conflict may be
    an important evolutionary force in speciation.

  abstract: >-
    A theoretical debate about whether parasitoids should be time or egg limited
    now recognizes both as feasible, and interest has turned to determining the
    circumstances under which each might arise in the field, and their
    implications for parasitoid behaviour and evolution. Egg loads of
    parasitoids sampled from the field are predicted to show a negative response
    to host availability, but empirical support for this relationship is scarce.
    We measured how a parasitoid's egg load responded to seasonal fluctuations
    in host population density and recorded the predicted correlation. In early
    summer, parasitoids were at high risk of time limitation due to low host
    availability, and in late summer, their offspring were at greater risk of
    egg limitation due to high host availability. Despite clear seasonal changes
    in selection pressures on egg load and lifespan, the parasitoid showed no
    evidence of seasonal variation in its reproductive strategy. We made minor
    modifications to a previously published model to explore the effects of
    seasonal variation in host availability on optimal investments in eggs and
    lifespan and obtained several new results. In particular, under
    circumstances analogous to some of those observed in our field study,
    temporal stochasticity in reproductive opportunities can cause investments
    in eggs to increase, rather than decrease as previously predicted. Our model
    results helped to explain the parasitoid's lack of a seasonally varying
    reproductive strategy. Understanding the evolution of parasitoid egg load
    would benefit from a shift of research emphasis from purely stochastic
    variation in parasitoid reproductive opportunities to greater consideration
    of host dynamics.

  abstract: >-
    Genome-wide single-cell analysis represents the ultimate frontier of
    genomics research. In particular, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)
    studies have been boosted in the last few years by an explosion of new
    technologies enabling the study of the transcriptomic landscape of thousands
    of single cells in complex multicellular organisms. More sensitive and
    automated methods are being continuously developed and promise to deliver
    better data quality and higher throughput with less hands-on time. The
    outstanding amount of knowledge that is going to be gained from present and
    future studies will have a profound impact in many aspects of our society,
    from the introduction of truly tailored cancer treatments, to a better
    understanding of antibiotic resistance and host-pathogen interactions; from
    the discovery of the mechanisms regulating stem cell differentiation to the
    characterization of the early event of human embryogenesis.

    Dietary restriction (DR) by dilution of the food medium can extend lifespan
    in Drosophila. DR results in a state that is characterized by reduced
    fecundity, increased starvation resistance and higher total lipid levels. In
    the past, each of these correlated phenotypes has been proposed to play a
    causal role in the lifespan-extending effects of food reduction. However,
    more recent data show that each phenotype can be uncoupled from the
    long-lived state to varying extents. In this mini-review, we summarize the
    principal findings of the effects of DR on Drosophila in order to address
    what these phenotypes can tell us about the physiological remodeling
    required for Drosophila to be long-lived. Current data indicate
    lifespan-extension by DR is likely to involve both enhancement of various
    defense and detoxification mechanisms and a complex range of metabolic
    alterations that make energy available for these processes. (c) 2005

    Background: We characterized RNA transcript levels for the whole Drosophila
    genome during normal aging. We compared age-dependent profiles from animals
    aged under full-nutrient conditions with profiles obtained from animals
    maintained on a low-calorie medium to determine if caloric restriction slows
    the aging process. Specific biological functions impacted by caloric
    restriction were identified using the Gene Ontology annotation. We used the
    global patterns of expression profiles to test if particular genomic regions
    contribute differentially to changes in transcript profiles with age and if
    global disregulation of gene expression occurs during aging.Results:
    Whole-genome transcript profiles contained a statistically powerful genetic
    signature of normal aging. Nearly 23% of the genome changed in transcript
    representation with age. Caloric restriction was accompanied by a slowing of
    the progression of normal, age-related changes in transcript levels. Many
    genes, including those associated with stress response and oogenesis, showed
    age-dependent transcript representation. Caloric restriction resulted in the
    downregulation of genes primarily involved in cell growth, metabolism, and
    reproduction. We found no evidence that age-dependent changes in
    transcription level were confined to genes localized to specific regions of
    the genome and found no support for widespread disregulation of gene
    expression with age.Conclusions: Aging is characterized by highly dynamic
    changes in the expression of many genes, which provides a powerful molecular
    description of the normal aging process. Caloric restriction extends life
    span by slowing down the rate of normal aging. Transcription levels of genes
    from a wide variety of biological functions and processes are impacted by
    age and dietary conditions.

  abstract: >-
    The endocellular bacterium Wolbachia manipulates the reproduction of its
    arthropod hosts for its own benefit by various means, the most widespread
    being cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). To date, the molecular mechanism
    involved in CI has not been elucidated. We examine here three different CI
    models described in previous literature, namely, the “lock-and-key”,
    “titration–restitution” and “slow-motion” models. We confront them with the
    full range of CI patterns discovered so far, including the most complex ones
    such as multiple infections, asymmetrical and partial compatibility
    relationships and the existence of Wolbachia variants that can rescue the
    host from CI but not induce it. We conclude that the lock-and-key model is
    the most parsimonious of the models and fits the observations best. The two
    other models cannot be categorically invalidated, but they encounter some
    difficulties that make additional hypotheses necessary. BioEssays

    The type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
    (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has emerged recently as a powerful
    method to manipulate the genomes of various organisms. Here, we report a
    toolbox for high-efficiency genome engineering of Drosophila melanogaster
    consisting of transgenic Cas9 lines and versatile guide RNA (gRNA)
    expression plasmids. Systematic evaluation reveals Cas9 lines with
    ubiquitous or germ-line–restricted patterns of activity. We also demonstrate
    differential activity of the same gRNA expressed from different U6 snRNA
    promoters, with the previously untested U6:3 promoter giving the most potent
    effect. An appropriate combination of Cas9 and gRNA allows targeting of
    essential and nonessential genes with transmission rates ranging from
    25–100%. We also demonstrate that our optimized CRISPR/Cas tools can be used
    for offset nicking-based mutagenesis. Furthermore, in combination with
    oligonucleotide or long double-stranded donor templates, our reagents allow
    precise genome editing by homology-directed repair with rates that make
    selection markers unnecessary. Last, we demonstrate a novel application of
    CRISPR/Cas-mediated technology in revealing loss-of-function phenotypes in
    somatic cells following efficient biallelic targeting by Cas9 expressed in a
    ubiquitous or tissue-restricted manner. Our CRISPR/Cas tools will facilitate
    the rapid evaluation of mutant phenotypes of specific genes and the precise
    modification of the genome with single-nucleotide precision. Our results
    also pave the way for high-throughput genetic screening with CRISPR/Cas.

  abstract: >-
    Pollinators are a key component of global biodiversity, providing vital
    ecosystem services to crops and wild plants. There is clear evidence of
    recent declines in both wild and domesticated pollinators, and parallel
    declines in the plants that rely upon them. Here we describe the nature and
    extent of reported declines, and review the potential drivers of pollinator
    loss, including habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens,
    alien species, climate change and the interactions between them. Pollinator
    declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important
    negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the
    maintenance of wild plant diversity, wider ecosystem stability, crop
    production, food security and human welfare.

  abstract: >-
    Grass flowers are highly derived compared to their eudicot counterparts. To
    delineate OsMADS1 functions in rice floret organ development we have
    examined its evolution and the consequences of its knockdown or
    overexpression. Molecular phylogeny suggests the co-evolution of OsMADS1
    with grass family diversification. OsMADS1 knockdown perturbs the
    differentiation of specific cell types in the lemma and palea, creating
    glume-like features, with severe derangements in lemma differentiation.
    Conversely, ectopic OsMADS1 expression suffices to direct lemma-like
    differentiation in the glume. Strikingly, in many OsMADS1 knockdown florets
    glume-like organs occupy all the inner whorls. Such effects in the second
    and third whorl are unexplained, as wild-type florets do not express OsMADS1
    in these primordia and because transcripts for rice B and C organ-identity
    genes are unaffected by OsMADS1 knockdown. Through a screen for OsMADS1
    targets we identify a flower-specific Nt-gh3 type gene, OsMGH3, as a
    downstream gene. The delayed transcription activation of OsMGH3 by
    dexamethasone-inducible OsMADS1 suggests indirect activation. The OsMGH3
    floret expression profile suggests a novel role for OsMADS1 as an
    early-acting regulator of second and third whorl organ fate. We thus
    demonstrate the differential contribution of OsMADS1 for lemma versus palea
    development and provide evidence for its regulatory function in patterning
    inner whorl organs.

  abstract: >-
    The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains five class III homeodomain-leucine
    zipper genes. We have isolated loss-of-function alleles for each family
    member for use in genetic analysis. This gene family regulates apical embryo
    patterning, embryonic shoot meristem formation, organ polarity, vascular
    development, and meristem function. Genetic analyses revealed a complex
    pattern of overlapping functions, some of which are not readily inferred by
    phylogenetic relationships or by gene expression patterns. The PHABULOSA and
    PHAVOLUTA genes perform overlapping functions with REVOLUTA, whereas the
    PHABULOSA, PHAVOLUTA, and CORONA/ATHB15 genes perform overlapping functions
    distinct from REVOLUTA. Furthermore, ATHB8 and CORONA encode functions that
    are both antagonistic to those of REVOLUTA within certain tissues and
    overlapping with REVOLUTA in other tissues. Differences in expression
    patterns explain some of these genetic interactions, whereas other
    interactions are likely attributable to differences in protein function as
    indicated by cross-complementation studies.

    Arabidopsis class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip III) proteins play
    overlapping, distinct, and antagonistic roles in key aspects of development
    that have evolved during land plant evolution. To better understand this
    gene family's role in plant evolution and development as well as to address
    broader questions of how duplicated genes functionally diversify, we
    investigated the evolutionary history of this gene family. Phylogenetic
    analyses including homologs from diverse land plants indicate that a gene
    duplication event before the angiosperm–gymnosperm split gave rise to two
    gene lineages that diversified during angiosperm plant radiation.
    Heterologous expression of an HD-Zip III gene from the nonvascular plant
    moss within the Arabidopsis HD-zip III revoluta mutant modified but did not
    complement the phenotype. Comparison of the expression domains of flowering
    and nonflowering plant homologs indicate an ancestral role in vascular
    development and organ initiation but not in specifying organ polarity, a
    prominent role for angiosperm homologs.

  abstract: >-
    The independent evolution of morphological similarities is widespread. For
    simple traits, such as overall body colour, repeated transitions by means of
    mutations in the same gene may be common. However, for more complex traits,
    the possible genetic paths may be more numerous; the molecular mechanisms
    underlying their independent origins and the extent to which they are
    constrained to follow certain genetic paths are largely unknown. Here we
    show that a male wing pigmentation pattern involved in courtship display has
    been gained and lost multiple times in a Drosophila clade. Each of the cases
    we have analysed (two gains and two losses) involved regulatory changes at
    the pleiotropic pigmentation gene yellow. Losses involved the parallel
    inactivation of the same cis-regulatory element (CRE), with changes at a few
    nucleotides sufficient to account for the functional divergence of one
    element between two sibling species. Surprisingly, two independent gains of
    wing spots resulted from the co-option of distinct ancestral CREs. These
    results demonstrate how the functional diversification of the modular CREs
    of pleiotropic genes contributes to evolutionary novelty and the independent
    evolution of morphological similarities.

  abstract: >-
    To understand the constraints on biological diversity, we analyzed how
    selection and development interact to control the evolution of
    inflorescences, the branching structures that bear flowers. We show that a
    single developmental model accounts for the restricted range of
    inflorescence types observed in nature and that this model is supported by
    molecular genetic studies. The model predicts associations between
    inflorescence architecture, climate, and life history, which we validated
    empirically. Paths, or evolutionary wormholes, link different architectures
    in a multidimensional fitness space, but the rate of evolution along these
    paths is constrained by genetic and environmental factors, which explains
    why some evolutionary transitions are rare between closely related plant
    taxa.

    The insulin signaling pathway, which is conserved in evolution from flies to
    humans, evolved to allow a fast response to changes in nutrient availability
    while keeping glucose concentration constant in serum. Here we show that,
    both in Drosophila and mammals, insulin receptor (InR) represses its own
    synthesis by a feedback mechanism directed by the transcription factor
    dFOXO/FOXO1. In Drosophila, dFOXO is responsible for activating
    transcription of dInR, and nutritional conditions can modulate this effect.
    Starvation up-regulates mRNA of dInR in wild-type but not dFOXO-deficient
    flies. Importantly, FOXO1 acts in mammalian cells like its Drosophila
    counterpart, up-regulating the InR mRNA level upon fasting. Mammalian cells
    up-regulate the InR mRNA in the absence of serum, conditions that induce the
    dephosphorylation and activation of FOXO1. Interestingly, insulin is able to
    reverse this effect. Therefore, dFOXO/FOXO1 acts as an insulin sensor to
    activate insulin signaling, allowing a fast response to the hormone after
    each meal. Our results reveal a key feedback control mechanism for
    dFOXO/FOXO1 in regulating metabolism and insulin signaling.

    Author Summary M. persicae is the most economically important aphid pest in
    many regions of the world due to its large host range and the damage it
    causes through direct feeding and through the transmission of plant viruses.
    This species has developed resistance to most classes of insecticide; and
    although, to date, the neonicotinoids have remained an effective control
    measure, recent reports of resistance in M. persicae represent a threat to
    the long-term effectiveness of this chemical class. Work on other insect
    species has shown that resistance can arise through increased production of
    metabolic enzymes (such as cytochrome P450s) that detoxify the insecticide.
    In this study we made use of recent advances in genomics to quantify the
    expression of all genes encoding detoxification enzymes in a resistant
    strain of M. persicae. We found resistance correlated with the
    over-expression of a single P450 gene, and we show that this is due to gene
    amplification. We also showed that over-expression of cuticular proteins and
    reduced penetration of insecticide through the cuticle may also play a role
    in resistance. These findings will influence the design and monitoring of
    management strategies that aim to slow or prevent the development of
    resistance.

    Architecture of the rice inflorescence, which is determined mainly by the
    morphology, number and length of primary and secondary inflorescence
    branches, is an important agronomical trait. In the current study, we
    characterized a novel dense and erect panicle (EP) mutant, dep3, derived
    from the Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cultivar Hwacheong treated with
    N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. The panicle of the dep3 mutant remained erect from
    flowering to full maturation, whereas the panicle of the wild type plant
    began to droop after flowering. The dep3 mutation also regulated other
    panicle characteristics, including panicle length, grain shape and grain
    number per panicle. Anatomical observations revealed that the dep3 mutant
    had more small vascular bundles and a thicker culm than wild type plants,
    explaining the EP phenotype. Genetic analysis indicated that the phenotype
    with the dense and EP was controlled by a single recessive gene, termed
    dep3. The DEP3 gene was identified as the candidate via a map-based cloning
    approach and was predicted to encode a patatin-like phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
    superfamily domain-containing protein. The mutant allele gene carried a 408
    bp genomic deletion within LOC_Os06g46350, which included the last 47 bp
    coding region of the third exon and the first 361 bp of the 3'-untranslated
    region. Taken together, our results indicated that the patatin-like PLA2
    might play a significant role in the formation of vascular bundles, and that
    the dep3 mutant may provide another EP resource for rice breeding programs.

    Cold hardening treatment - a brief exposure to low temperatures - can
    protect certain insects against subsequent exposure to temperatures
    sufficiently low to cause damage or lethality. Microarray analysis to
    examine the changes in transcript abundance associated with cold hardening
    treatment (0 degrees C for 2 h followed by 30 min recovery at 25 degrees C)
    was undertaken in Drosophila melanogaster in order to gain insight into this
    phenomenon. Transcripts associated with 36 genes were identified, a subset
    of which appeared to be also differentially expressed after heat shock
    treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to independently determine
    transcript abundance of a subset of these sequences. Taken together, these
    assays suggest that stress proteins, including Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp83 and Frost
    as well as membrane-associated proteins may contribute to the cold hardening
    response.

    OBJECTIVE:CYP3A metabolizes 50% of currently prescribed drugs and is
    frequently involved in clinically relevant drug interactions. The
    understanding of roles and regulations of the individual CYP3A genes in
    pharmacology and physiology is incomplete. METHODS:Using genomic sequences
    from 16 species we investigated the evolution of CYP3 genomic loci over a
    period of 450 million years. RESULTS:CYP3A genes in amniota evolved from two
    ancestral CYP3A genes. Upon the emergence of eutherian mammals, one of them
    was lost, whereas, the other acquired a novel genomic environment owing to
    translocation. In primates, CYP3A underwent rapid evolutionary changes
    involving multiple gene duplications, deletions, pseudogenizations, and gene
    conversions. The expansion of CYP3A in catarrhines (Old World monkeys, great
    apes, and humans) differed substantially from New World primates (e.g.
    common marmoset) and strepsirrhines (e.g. galago). We detected two recent
    episodes of particularly strong positive selection acting on primate CYP3A
    protein-coding sequence: (i) on CYP3A7 early in hominoid evolution, which
    was accompanied by a restriction of its hepatic expression to fetal period
    and (ii) on human CYP3A4 following the split of the chimpanzee and human
    lineages. In agreement with these findings, three out of four positively
    selected amino acids investigated in previous biochemical studies of CYP3A
    affect the activity and regioselectivity. CONCLUSIONS:CYP3A7 and CYP3A4 may
    have acquired catalytic functions especially important for the evolution of
    hominoids and humans, respectively.

  abstract: >-
    Insects use hydrocarbons as cuticular waterproofing agents and as contact
    pheromones. Although their biosynthesis from fatty acyl precursors is well
    established, the last step of hydrocarbon biosynthesis from long-chain fatty
    aldehydes has remained mysterious. We show here that insects use a P450
    enzyme of the CYP4G family to oxidatively produce hydrocarbons from
    aldehydes. Oenocyte-directed RNAi knock-down of Drosophila CYP4G1 or
    NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase results in flies deficient in cuticular
    hydrocarbons, highly susceptible to desiccation, and with reduced viability
    upon adult emergence. The heterologously expressed enzyme converts
    C18-trideuterated octadecanal to C17-trideuterated heptadecane, showing that
    the insect enzyme is an oxidative decarbonylase that catalyzes the cleavage
    of long-chain aldehydes to hydrocarbons with the release of carbon dioxide.
    This process is unlike cyanobacteria that use a nonheme diiron decarbonylase
    to make alkanes from aldehydes with the release of formate. The unique and
    highly conserved insect CYP4G enzymes are a key evolutionary innovation that
    allowed their colonization of land.

    Single-cell trajectories can unveil how gene regulation governs cell fate
    decisions. However, learning the structure of complex trajectories with
    multiple branches remains a challenging computational problem. We present
    Monocle 2, an algorithm that uses reversed graph embedding to describe
    multiple fate decisions in a fully unsupervised manner. We applied Monocle 2
    to two studies of blood development and found that mutations in the genes
    encoding key lineage transcription factors divert cells to alternative
    fates.

    The human reference genome serves as the foundation for genomics by
    providing a scaffold for alignment of sequencing reads, but currently only
    reflects a single consensus haplotype, thus impairing analysis accuracy.
    Here we present a graph reference genome implementation that enables read
    alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and
    4.0 million insertions and deletions (indels). The pipeline processes one
    whole-genome sequencing sample in 6.5 h using a system with 36 CPU cores. We
    show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity
    and produces a 0.5% increase in variant calling recall, with unaffected
    specificity. Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be
    genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that
    iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant
    calling accuracy. Our implementation is an important advance toward
    fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability
    and accuracy of genomic analyses.

  abstract: >-
    The emergence of insecticide resistance in the mosquito poses a serious
    threat to the efficacy of many malaria control programs. We have searched
    the Anopheles gambiae genome for members of the three major enzyme families—
    the carboxylesterases, glutathione transferases, and cytochrome P450s—that
    are primarily responsible for metabolic resistance to insecticides. A
    comparative genomic analysis with Drosophila melanogaster reveals that a
    considerable expansion of these supergene families has occurred in the
    mosquito. Low gene orthology and little chromosomal synteny paradoxically
    contrast the easily identified orthologous groups of genes presumably seeded
    by common ancestors. In A. gambiae, the independent expansion of paralogous
    genes is mainly a consequence of the formation of clusters among locally
    duplicated genes. These expansions may reflect the functional
    diversification of supergene families consistent with major differences in
    the life history and ecology of these organisms. These data provide a basis
    for identifying the resistance-associated enzymes within these families.
    This will enable the resistance status of mosquitoes, flies, and possibly
    other holometabolous insects to be monitored. The analyses also provide the
    means for identifying previously unknown molecules involved in fundamental
    biological processes such as development.

    The sequence and cytological location of five Anopheles gambiae glutathione
    S-transferase (GST) genes are described. Three of these genes, aggst1-8,
    aggst1-9 and aggst1-10, belong to the insect class I family and are located
    on chromosome 2R, in close proximity to previously described members of this
    gene family. The remaining two genes, aggst3-1 and aggst3-2, have a low
    sequence similarity to either of the two previously recognized classes of
    insect GSTs and this prompted a re-evaluation of the classification of
    insect GST enzymes. We provide evidence for seven possible classes of insect
    protein with GST-like subunits. Four of these contain sequences with
    significant similarities to mammalian GSTs. The largest novel insect GST
    class, class III, contains functional GST enzymes including two of the A.
    gambiae GSTs described in this report and GSTs from Drosophila melanogaster,
    Musca domestica, Manduca sexta and Plutella xylostella. The genes encoding
    the class III GST of A. gambiae map to a region of the genome on chromosome
    3R that contains a major DDT
    [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] resistance gene, suggesting
    that this gene family is involved in GST-based resistance in this important
    malaria vector. In further support of their role in resistance, we show that
    the mRNA levels of aggst3-2 are approx. 5-fold higher in a DDT resistant
    strain than in the susceptible strain and demonstrate that recombinant
    AgGST3-2 has very high DDT dehydrochlorinase activity.

    A large number of computational methods have been developed for analyzing
    differential gene expression in RNA-seq data. We describe a comprehensive
    evaluation of common methods using the SEQC benchmark dataset and ENCODE
    data. We consider a number of key features, including normalization,
    accuracy of differential expression detection and differential expression
    analysis when one condition has no detectable expression. We find
    significant differences among the methods, but note that array-based methods
    adapted to RNA-seq data perform comparably to methods designed for RNA-seq.
    Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of replicate samples
    significantly improves detection power over increased sequencing depth.

    MOTIVATION:In recent years, gene expression studies have increasingly made
    use of high-throughput sequencing technology. In turn, research concerning
    the appropriate statistical methods for the analysis of digital gene
    expression (DGE) has flourished, primarily in the context of normalization
    and differential analysis. RESULTS:In this work, we focus on the question of
    clustering DGE profiles as a means to discover groups of co-expressed genes.
    We propose a Poisson mixture model using a rigorous framework for parameter
    estimation as well as the choice of the appropriate number of clusters. We
    illustrate co-expression analyses using our approach on two real RNA-seq
    datasets. A set of simulation studies also compares the performance of the
    proposed model with that of several related approaches developed to cluster
    RNA-seq or serial analysis of gene expression data. AVAILABILITY AND AND
    IMPLEMENTATION:The proposed method is implemented in the open-source R
    package HTSCluster, available on CRAN. CONTACT:andrea.rau@jouy.inra.fr
    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics

    Several studies have shown that global crop production needs to double by
    2050 to meet the projected demands from rising population, diet shifts, and
    increasing biofuels consumption. Boosting crop yields to meet these rising
    demands, rather than clearing more land for agriculture has been highlighted
    as a preferred solution to meet this goal. However, we first need to
    understand how crop yields are changing globally, and whether we are on
    track to double production by 2050. Using ∼2.5 million agricultural
    statistics, collected for ∼13,500 political units across the world, we track
    four key global crops-maize, rice, wheat, and soybean-that currently produce
    nearly two-thirds of global agricultural calories. We find that yields in
    these top four crops are increasing at 1.6%, 1.0%, 0.9%, and 1.3% per year,
    non-compounding rates, respectively, which is less than the 2.4% per year
    rate required to double global production by 2050. At these rates global
    production in these crops would increase by ∼67%, ∼42%, ∼38%, and ∼55%,
    respectively, which is far below what is needed to meet projected demands in
    2050. We present detailed maps to identify where rates must be increased to
    boost crop production and meet rising demands.

  abstract: >-
    Spatiotemporal changes in gene expression underlie many evolutionary
    novelties in nature. However, the evolutionary origins of novel expression
    patterns, and the transcriptional control elements ("enhancers") that govern
    them, remain unclear. Here, we sought to explore the molecular genetic
    mechanisms by which new enhancers arise. We undertook a survey of closely
    related Drosophila species to identify recently evolved novel gene
    expression patterns and traced their evolutionary history. Analyses of gene
    expression in a variety of developing tissues of the Drosophila melanogaster
    species subgroup revealed high rates of expression pattern divergence,
    including numerous evolutionary losses, heterochronic shifts, and expansions
    or contractions of expression domains. However, gains of novel expression
    patterns were much less frequent. One gain was observed for the Neprilysin-1
    (Nep1) gene, which has evolved a unique expression pattern in optic lobe
    neuroblasts of Drosophila santomea. Dissection of the Nep1 cis-regulatory
    region localized a newly derived optic lobe enhancer activity to a region of
    an intron that has accumulated a small number of mutations. The Nep1 optic
    lobe enhancer overlaps with other enhancer activities, from which the novel
    activity was co-opted. We suggest that the novel optic lobe enhancer evolved
    by exploiting the cryptic activity of extant regulatory sequences, and this
    may reflect a general mechanism whereby new enhancers evolve.

  abstract: >-
    An unusual mechanism for hydrocarbon biosynthesis is proposed from work
    examining the formation of (Z)-9-tricosene (Z9-23:Hy), the major sex
    pheromone component of the female housefly, Musca domestica. Incubation of
    (Z)-15-[1-C-14]- and (Z)-15-[15,16-H-3(2)]tetracosenoic acid (24:1 fatty
    acid) with microsomes from houseflies gave equal amounts of [3H]Z9-23:Hy and
    (CO2)-C-14. The formation of CO2 and not CO, as reported for hydrocarbon
    formation in plants, animals, and microorganisms [Dennis, M. and
    Kolattukudy, P. E. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 5306-5310], was
    verified by trapping agents and by radio-GLC analysis. Incubation of
    (2)-15-[15,16-3H(2)] tetracosenoyl-CoA with microsomal preparations in the
    presence of NADPH and O-2 gave almost equal amounts of
    (Z)-15-H-3(2)]tetrasosenal (24:1 aldehyde) and Z9-23:Hy. Addition of
    increasing amounts of hydroxylamine (aldehyde trapping agent) caused a
    decrease in hydrocarbon formation with a concomitant increase in oxime
    (aldehyde derivative) formation. The 24:1 aldehyde was efficiently converted
    to (Z)-9-tricosene only in the presence of both NADPH and O-2. Bubbling
    carbon monoxide (20:80 CO/O-2) or including an antibody against housefly
    cytochrome P450 reductase inhibited the formation Z9-23:Hy from 24:1
    aldehyde. These data demonstrate an unusual mechanism for hydrocarbon
    formation in insects in which the acyl-CoA is reduced to the corresponding
    aldehyde and then carbon-1 is removed as CO2. The requirement for NADPH and
    O-2 and the inhibition by CO and the antibody to cytochrome P450 reductase
    strongly implicate the participation of a cytochrome P450 in this reaction.

  abstract: >-
    Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single gene
    in the last common ancestor of these species. Such genes have often retained
    identical biological roles in the present-day organisms. It is hence
    important to identify orthologs for transferring functional information
    between genes in different organisms with a high degree of reliability. For
    example, orthologs of human proteins are often functionally characterized in
    model organisms. Unfortunately, orthology analysis between human and e.g.
    invertebrates is often complex because of large numbers of paralogs within
    protein families. Paralogs that predate the species split, which we call
    out-paralogs, can easily be confused with true orthologs. Paralogs that
    arose after the species split, which we call in-paralogs, however, are bona
    fide orthologs by definition. Orthologs and in-paralogs are typically
    detected with phylogenetic methods, but these are slow and difficult to
    automate. Automatic clustering methods based on two-way best genome-wide
    matches on the other hand, have so far not separated in-paralogs from
    out-paralogs effectively. We present a fully automatic method for finding
    orthologs and in-paralogs from two species. Ortholog clusters are seeded
    with a two-way best pairwise match, after which an algorithm for adding
    in-paralogs is applied. The method bypasses multiple alignments and
    phylogenetic trees, which can be slow and error-prone steps in classical
    ortholog detection. Still, it robustly detects complex orthologous
    relationships and assigns confidence values for both orthologs and
    in-paralogs. The program, called INPARANOID, was tested on all completely
    sequenced eukaryotic genomes. To assess the quality of INPARANOID results,
    ortholog clusters were generated from a dataset of worm and mammalian
    transmembrane proteins, and were compared to clusters derived by manual
    tree-based ortholog detection methods. This study led to the identification
    with a high degree of confidence of over a dozen novel worm-mammalian
    ortholog assignments that were previously undetected because of shortcomings
    of phylogenetic methods.A WWW server that allows searching for orthologs
    between human and several fully sequenced genomes is installed at
    http://www.cgb.ki.se/inparanoid/. This is the first comprehensive resource
    with orthologs of all fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Programs and
    tables of orthology assignments are available from the same location.

  abstract: >-
    The Resistance to Dieldrin gene, Rdl, encodes a GABA-gated chloride channel
    subunit that is targeted by cyclodiene and phenylpyrazole insecticides. The
    gene was first characterized in Drosophila melanogaster by genetic mapping
    of resistance to the cyclodiene dieldrin. The 4,000-fold resistance observed
    was due to a single amino acid replacement, Ala(301) to Ser. The equivalent
    change was subsequently identified in Rdl orthologs of a large range of
    resistant insect species. Here, we report identification of a duplication at
    the Rdl locus in D. melanogaster. The 113-kb duplication contains one WT
    copy of Rdl and a second copy with two point mutations: an Ala(301) to Ser
    resistance mutation and Met(360) to Ile replacement. Individuals with this
    duplication exhibit intermediate dieldrin resistance compared with single
    copy Ser(301) homozygotes, reduced temperature sensitivity, and altered RNA
    editing associated with the resistant allele. Ectopic recombination between
    Roo transposable elements is involved in generating this genomic
    rearrangement. The duplication phenotypes were confirmed by construction of
    a transgenic, artificial duplication integrating the 55.7-kb Rdl locus with
    a Ser(301) change into an Ala(301) background. Gene duplications can
    contribute significantly to the evolution of insecticide resistance, most
    commonly by increasing the amount of gene product produced. Here however,
    duplication of the Rdl target site creates permanent heterozygosity,
    providing unique potential for adaptive mutations to accrue in one copy,
    without abolishing the endogenous role of an essential gene.

  abstract: >-
    Extensive use of older generation insecticides may result in pre-existing
    cross-resistance to new chemical classes acting at the same target site.
    Phenylpyrazole insecticides block inhibitory neurotransmission in insects
    via their action on ligand-gated chloride channels (LGCCs). Phenylpyrazoles
    are broad-spectrum insecticides widely used in agriculture and domestic pest
    control. So far, all identified cases of target site resistance to
    phenylpyrazoles are based on mutations in the Rdl (Resistance to dieldrin)
    LGCC subunit, the major target site for cyclodiene insecticides. We examined
    the role that mutations in Rdl have on phenylpyrazole resistance in
    Drosophila melanogaster, exploring naturally occurring variation, and
    generating predicted resistance mutations by mutagenesis. Natural variation
    at the Rdl locus in inbred strains of D. melanogaster included gene
    duplication, and a line containing two Rdl mutations found in a highly
    resistant line of D. simulans. These mutations had a moderate impact on
    survival following exposure to two phenylpyrazoles, fipronil and pyriprole.
    Homology modelling suggested that the Rdl chloride channel pore contains key
    residues for binding fipronil and pyriprole. Mutagenesis of these sites and
    assessment of resistance in vivo in transgenic lines showed that amino acid
    identity at the Ala(301) site influenced resistance levels, with glycine
    showing greater survival than serine replacement. We confirm that point
    mutations at the Rdl 301 site provide moderate resistance to phenylpyrazoles
    in D. melanogaster. We also emphasize the beneficial aspects of testing
    predicted mutations in a whole organism to validate a candidate gene
    approach.

- id: renMULTIFLORETSPIKELET1Which2013
  abstract: >-
    The spikelet is a unique inflorescence structure of grass. The molecular
    mechanism that controls the development of the spikelet remains unclear. In
    this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet mutant,
    multi-floret spikelet1 (mfs1), that showed delayed transformation of
    spikelet meristems to floral meristems, which resulted in an extra hull-like
    organ and an elongated rachilla. In addition, the sterile lemma was
    homeotically converted to the rudimentary glume and the body of the palea
    was degenerated in mfs1. These results suggest that the MULTI-FLORET
    SPIKELET1 (MFS1) gene plays an important role in the regulation of spikelet
    meristem determinacy and floral organ identity. MFS1 belongs to an unknown
    function clade in the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family.
    The MFS1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized in the
    nucleus. MFS1 messenger RNA is expressed in various tissues, especially in
    the spikelet and floral meristems. Furthermore, our findings suggest that
    MFS1 positively regulates the expression of LONG STERILE LEMMA and the
    INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1)-like genes SUPERNUMERARY BRACT and OsIDS1.

    We report the draft genome sequence of the model moss Physcomitrella patens
    and compare its features with those of flowering plants, from which it is
    separated by more than 400 million years, and unicellular aquatic algae.
    This comparison reveals genomic changes concomitant with the evolutionary
    movement to land, including a general increase in gene family complexity;
    loss of genes associated with aquatic environments (e.g., flagellar arms);
    acquisition of genes for tolerating terrestrial stresses (e.g., variation in
    temperature and water availability); and the development of the auxin and
    abscisic acid signaling pathways for coordinating multicellular growth and
    dehydration response. The Physcomitrella genome provides a resource for
    phylogenetic inferences about gene function and for experimental analysis of
    plant processes through this plant's unique facility for reverse genetics.

    The ecdysone 20-monooxygenase (E20MO; 20-hydroxylase) is the enzyme that
    mediates the conversion of ecdysone (E) to the active insect molting
    hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which coordinates developmental
    progression. We report the identification and developmental expression of
    the Halloween gene shade (shd; CYP314A1) that encodes the E20MO in the
    tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Manduca Shd (MsShd) mediates the conversion
    of E to 20E when expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. In accord with the
    central dogma, the data show that Msshd is expressed mainly in the midgut,
    Malpighian tubules, fat body and epidermis with very low expression in the
    prothoracic gland and nervous system. Developmental variations in E20MO
    enzymatic activity are almost perfectly correlated with comparable changes
    in the gene expression of Msshd in the fat body and midgut during the fifth
    instar and the beginning of pupal-adult development. The results indicate
    three successive and overlapping peaks of expression in the fat body, midgut
    and Malpighian tubules, respectively, during the fifth larval instar. The
    data suggest that precise tissue-specific transcriptional regulation
    controls the levels, and thereby the activity, of the Manduca E20MO. (c)

    The insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is a major modulator

    During evolution selective forces have preserved the Halloween genes

    20E. In the present study, we examine the phylogenetic relationships of
    these P450 genes in holometabolous insects belonging to the orders
    Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. The analyzed insect
    genomes each contains single orthologs of Phantom (CYP306A1), Disembodied
    (CYP302A1), Shadow (CYP315A1) and Shade (CYP314A1), the terminal
    hydroxylases. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Halloween gene spook
    (Cyp307a1) is required for the biosynthesis of 20E, although a function has
    not yet been identified. Unlike the other Halloween genes, the ancestor of
    this gene evolved into three paralogs, all in the CYP307 family, through
    gene duplication. The genomic stability of these paralogs varies among
    species. Intron–exon structures indicate that D. melanogaster Cyp307a1 is a
    mRNA-derived paralog of spookier (Cyp307a2), which is the ancestral gene and
    the closest ortholog of the coleopteran, lepidopteran and mosquito CYP307A
    subfamily genes. Evolutionary links between the insect Halloween genes and
    vertebrate steroidogenic P450s suggest that they originated from common
    ancestors, perhaps destined for steroidogenesis, before the
    deuterostome–arthropod split. Conservation of putative substrate recognition
    sites of orthologous Halloween genes indicates selective constraint on these
    residues to prevent functional divergence. The results suggest that
    duplications of ancestral P450 genes that acquired novel functions may have
    been an important mechanism for evolving the ecdysteroidogenic pathway.

  abstract: >-
    Steroid hormones are systemic signaling molecules that regulate
    juvenile-adult transitions in both insects and mammals. In insects, pulses
    of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) are generated by increased
    biosynthesis followed by inactivation/clearance. Although mechanisms that
    control 20E synthesis have received considerable recent attention, the
    physiological significance of 20E inactivation remains largely unknown. We
    show that the cytochrome P450 Cyp18a1 lowers 20E titer during the Drosophila
    prepupal to pupal transition. Furthermore, this reduction of 20E levels is a
    prerequisite to induce βFTZ-F1, a key factor in the genetic hierarchy that
    controls early metamorphosis. Resupplying βFTZ-F1 rescues Cyp18a1-deficient
    prepupae. Because Cyp18a1 is 20E-inducible, it appears that the increased
    production of steroid is responsible for its eventual decline, thereby
    generating the regulatory pulse required for proper temporal progression of
    metamorphosis. The coupling of hormone clearance to βFTZ-F1 expression
    suggests a general mechanism by which transient signaling drives
    unidirectional progression through a multistep process.

  abstract: >-
    The last decade of decreasing DNA sequencing costs and proliferating
    sequencing services in core labs and companies has brought the de-novo
    genome sequencing and assembly of insect species within reach for many
    entomologists. However, sequence production alone is not enough to generate
    a high quality reference genome, and in many cases, poor planning can lead
    to extremely fragmented genome assemblies preventing high quality gene
    annotation and other desired analyses. Insect genomes can be problematic to
    assemble, due to combinations of high polymorphism, inability to breed for
    genome homozygocity, and small physical sizes limiting the quantity of DNA
    able to be isolated from a single individual. Recent advances in sequencing
    technology and assembly strategies are enabling a revolution for insect
    genome reference sequencing and assembly. Here we review historical and new
    genome sequencing and assembly strategies, with a particular focus on their
    application to arthropod genomes. We highlight both the need to design
    sequencing strategies for the requirements of the assembly software, and new
    long-read technologies that are enabling a return to traditional assembly
    approaches. Finally, we compare and contrast very cost effective short read
    draft genome strategies with the long read approaches that although
    entailing additional cost, bring a higher likelihood of success and the
    possibility of archival assembly qualities approaching that of finished
    genomes.

  abstract: >-
    Wolbachia bacteria are common insect endosymbionts transmitted maternally
    and capable of spreading through insect populations by cytoplasmic
    incompatibility (CI) when infected males cause embryo death after mating
    with uninfected females. Selection in the Wolbachia endosymbiont occurs on
    female hosts and is expected to favour strong maternal transmission to
    female offspring, even at the cost of reduced CI. With maternal leakage,
    nuclear genes are expected to be selected to suppress cytoplasmic
    incompatibility caused by males while also reducing any deleterious effects
    associated with the infection. Here we describe a new type of Wolbachia
    strain from Drosophila pseudotakahashii likely to have arisen from
    evolutionary processes on host and/or Wolbachia genomes. This strain is
    often absent from adult male offspring, but always transmitted to females.
    It leads to males with low or non-detectable Wolbachia that nevertheless
    show CI. When detected in adult males, the infection has a low density
    relative to that in females, a phenomenon not previously seen in Wolbachia
    infections of Drosophila. This Wolbachia strain is common in natural
    populations, and shows reduced CI when older (infected) males are crossed.
    These patterns highlight that endosymbionts can have strong sex-specific
    effects and that high frequency Wolbachia strains persist through effects on
    female reproduction. Female-limited Wolbachia infections may be of applied
    interest if the low level of Wolbachia in males reduces deleterious fitness
    effects on the host.

  abstract: >-
    Periodic food shortages are a major challenge faced by organisms in natural
    habitats. Cave-dwelling animals must withstand long periods of nutrient
    deprivation, as—in the absence of photosynthesis—caves depend on external
    energy sources such as seasonal floods1. Here we show that cave-adapted
    populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have dysregulated
    blood glucose homeostasis and are insulin-resistant compared to
    river-adapted populations. We found that multiple cave populations carry a
    mutation in the insulin receptor that leads to decreased insulin binding in
    vitro and contributes to hyperglycaemia. Hybrid fish from surface–cave
    crosses carrying this mutation weigh more than non-carriers, and zebrafish
    genetically engineered to carry the mutation have increased body weight and
    insulin resistance. Higher body weight may be advantageous in caves as a
    strategy to cope with an infrequent food supply. In humans, the identical
    mutation in the insulin receptor leads to a severe form of insulin
    resistance and reduced lifespan. However, cavefish have a similar lifespan
    to surface fish and do not accumulate the advanced glycation end-products in
    the blood that are typically associated with the progression of
    diabetes-associated pathologies. Our findings suggest that diminished
    insulin signalling is beneficial in a nutrient-limited environment and that
    cavefish may have acquired compensatory mechanisms that enable them to
    circumvent the typical negative effects associated with failure to regulate
    blood glucose levels.

  abstract: >-
    Abamectin is one of the most important insecticides worldwide. It is used
    against major agricultural pests and insects of public health importance, as
    well as against endoparasites in animal health. Abamectin has been used
    successfully for the control of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a major
    agricultural pest with global distribution, an extremely diverse host range,
    and a remarkable ability to develop resistance against insecticides
    including abamectin. Target site resistance mutations may explain a large
    part of resistance, although genetic evidence and transcriptomic data
    indicated that additional mechanisms may also be implicated in the abamectin
    resistant phenotype. To investigate a functional link between cytochrome
    P450-mediated metabolism and abamectin resistance, we recombinantly
    expressed three cytochrome P450s (CYP392A16, CYP392D8 and CYP392D10) that
    have been associated with high levels of abamectin resistance in a resistant
    T. urticae strain isolated from Greece. CYP392A16 was expressed
    predominately in its P450 form however, both CYP392D8 and CYP392D10 were
    expressed predominately as P420, despite optimization efforts on expression
    conditions. CYP392A16 catalyses the hydroxylation of abamectin (Kcat = 0.54
    pmol/min/pmol P450; Km = 45.9 μM), resulting in a substantially less toxic
    compound as confirmed by bioassays with the partially purified metabolite.
    However, CYP392A16 did not metabolize hexythiazox, clofentezine and
    bifenthrin, active ingredients that also showed reduced toxicity in the
    abamectin resistant strain. Among a number of fluorescent and luminescent
    substrates screened, Luciferin-ME EGE was preferentially metabolized by
    CYP392A16, and it may be a potential diagnostic probe for metabolic
    resistance detection and monitoring.

  abstract: >-
    Recent developments in third-gen long read sequencing and diploid-aware
    assemblers have resulted in the rapid release of numerous reference-quality
    assemblies for diploid genomes. However, assembly of highly heterozygous
    genomes is still problematic when regional heterogeneity is so high that
    haplotype homology is not recognised during assembly. This results in
    regional duplication rather than consolidation into allelic variants and can
    cause issues with downstream analysis, for example variant discovery, or
    haplotype reconstruction using the diploid assembly with unpaired allelic
    contigs.

    SUMMARY:We describe a new 'reference annotation based transcript assembly'
    problem for RNA-Seq data that involves assembling novel transcripts in the
    context of an existing annotation. This problem arises in the analysis of
    expression in model organisms, where it is desirable to leverage existing
    annotations for discovering novel transcripts. We present an algorithm for
    reference annotation-based transcript assembly and show how it can be used
    to rapidly investigate novel transcripts revealed by RNA-Seq in comparison
    with a reference annotation. AVAILABILITY:The methods described in this
    article are implemented in the Cufflinks suite of software for RNA-Seq,

  abstract: >-
    It is well established that spermatogenesis is controlled by gonadotrophins
    and testosterone. However, a role for estrogens in male reproduction
    recently was suggested in adult mice deficient in estrogen receptor cu,
    These mice became infertile primarily because of an interruption of fluid
    reabsorption by the efferent ductules of the epididymis, thus. leading to a
    disruption of the seminiferous epithelium [Hess,. R. A., Bunick, D., Lee, K.
    H., Bahr, J., Taylor, J. A., Korach, K. S., and Lubabn, D. B. (1997) Nature
    (London) 390, 509-512], Despite the demonstration of the aromatase enzyme,
    which converts androgens to estrogens, and estrogen receptors within the
    rodent seminiferous epithelium, the role of aromatase and estrogen in germ
    cell development is unknown. We have investigated spermatogenesis in mice
    that lack aromatase because of the targeted disruption of the cyp19 gene
    (ArKO). Male mice deficient in aromatase were initially fertile but
    developed progressive infertility, until their ability to sire pups was
    severely impaired. The mice deficient in aromatase developed disruptions to
    spermatogenesis between 4.5 months and 1 year, despite no decreases in
    gonadotrophins or androgens, Spermatogenesis primarily was arrested at early
    spermatogenic stages, as characterized by an increase in apoptosis and the
    appearance of multinucleated cells, and there was a significant reduction in
    round and elongated spermatids, but no changes in Sertoli cells and earlier
    germ cells. In addition, Leydig cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy was evident,
    presumably as a consequence of increased circulating luteinizing hormone.
    Our findings indicate that local expression of aromatase is essential for
    spermatogenesis and provide evidence for a direct action of estrogen on male
    germ cell development and thus fertility.

  abstract: >-
    Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the beta-esterase gene cluster in
    the Drosophila genus using the recently released genome sequences of 12
    Drosophila species. Molecular evolution in this small cluster is noteworthy
    because it contains contrasting examples of the types and stages of loss of
    gene function. Specifically, missing orthologs, pseudogenes, and null
    alleles are all inferred. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest a minimum of 9
    gene gain-loss events; however, the exact number and age of these events is
    confounded by interparalog recombination. A previous enigma, in which
    allozyme loci were mapped to beta-esterase genes that lacked catalytically
    essential amino acids, was resolved through the identification of
    neighbouring genes that contain the canonical catalytic residues and thus
    presumably encode the mapped allozymes. The originally identified genes are
    evolving with selective constraint, suggesting that they have a
    "noncatalytic" function. Curiously, 3 of the 4 paralogous beta-esterase
    genes in the D. ananassae genome sequence have single inactivating
    (frame-shift or nonsense) mutations. To determine whether these putatively
    inactivating mutations were fixed, we sequenced other D. ananassae alleles
    of these four loci. We did not find any of the 3 inactivating mutations of
    the sequenced strain in 12 other strains; however, other inactivating
    mutations were observed in the same 3 genes. This is reminiscent of the high
    frequency of null alleles observed in one of the beta-esterase genes
    (Est7/EstP) of D. melanogaster.

    SUMMARY:It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE)
    technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for
    many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis
    tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether
    there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly
    different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software
    package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An
    overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and
    technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the
    degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of
    inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of
    replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is
    replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
    such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY:The package is freely
    available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site
    (http://bioconductor.org).

    The fine detail provided by sequencing-based transcriptome surveys suggests
    that RNA-seq is likely to become the platform of choice for interrogating
    steady state RNA. In order to discover biologically important changes in
    expression, we show that normalization continues to be an essential step in
    the analysis. We outline a simple and effective method for performing
    normalization and show dramatically improved results for inferring
    differential expression in simulated and publicly available data sets.

    Naupactus cervinus (Boheman) (Curculionidae, Naupactini) is a
    parthenogenetic weevil native to the Paranaense Forest which displays high
    levels of genetic variation. Two divergent clades were identified, one
    ranging in forest areas (Forest clade), and the other in open vegetation
    areas (Grassland clade). Both of them have individuals with high levels of
    heterozygosity in ribosomal sequences. Investigation of intraindividual
    variation in ITS1 sequences through cloning and posterior sequencing
    suggested that mating between both groups most likely occurred in the
    Paranaense Forest after a secondary contact, which led to fixed
    heterozygotes as a consequence of parthenogenesis. Otherwise, sexual
    segregation would have disrupted multilocus genotypes. Only a small number
    of heterozygous genotypes of all the possible combinations are found in
    nature. We propose the occurrence of a hybrid zone in the Paranaense Forest.
    The fact that it is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots of the
    world, together with its key role for investigating evolutionary processes,
    makes it worthy of conservation. This is the first genetic evidence of
    bisexuality in N. cervinus.

    <p>The spatial organization of cells in tissue has a profound influence on
    their function, yet a high-throughput, genome-wide readout of gene
    expression with cellular resolution is lacking. Here, we introduce
    Slide-seq, a highly scalable method that enables facile generation of large
    volumes of unbiased spatial transcriptomes with 10 micron spatial
    resolution, comparable to the size of individual cells. In Slide-seq, RNA is
    transferred from freshly frozen tissue sections onto a surface covered in
    DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the spatial locations of
    the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. To demonstrate Slide-seq9s utility, we
    localized cell types identified by large-scale scRNA-seq datasets within the
    cerebellum and hippocampus. We next systematically characterized spatial
    gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum,
    identifying new axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments.
    Finally, we used Slide-seq to define the temporal evolution of
    cell-type-specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.
    Slide-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine,
    high-resolution spatial mapping of gene expression.</p>

  abstract: >-
    Insect antennae have a primary function of detecting odors including sex
    pheromones and plant volatiles. The assumption that genes uniquely expressed
    in these antennae have an olfactory role has led to the identification of
    several genes that are integral components of odorant transduction, In the
    present study, differential display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was
    used to isolate 25 antennal-specific mRNAs from the male sphinx moth Manduca
    sexta, Northern blot analyses revealed that one clone, designated G7-9, was
    antennal-specific and was highly enriched in male antennae relative to
    female antennae. In situ hybridization indicated that G7-9 expression was
    restricted to a spatial domain of the olfactory epithelium occupied
    exclusively by sex-pheromone-sensitive olfactory sensilla, amino acid
    homology and phylogenetic analyses identified G7-9 as a
    glutathione-S-transferase (GST); we have named the full-length clone
    GST-msolf1, GSTs are known to function primarily in the detoxification of
    noxious compounds. Spectrophotometric and chromatographic analyses of total
    GST activity indicate that the endogenous GSTs of male and female antennae
    can modify trans-2-hexenal, a plant-derived green leaf aldehyde known to
    stimulate the olfactory system of M. sexta. The restricted localization of
    GST-msolf1 to sex-pheromone-sensitive sensilla, the fact that the sex
    pheromone of M. sexta consists of a complex mixture of aldehyde components,
    and the observation that antennal GSTs can modify an aldehyde odorant
    suggest that GST-msolf1 may have a role in signal termination. In the light
    of the more commonly observed role of GSTs in xenobiotic metabolism, we
    propose that GST-msolf1 may play a dual role of protecting the olfactory
    system from harmful xenobiotics and inactivating aldehyde odorants,
    especially components of the M. sexta sex pheromone.

    The hypothesis that differences in gene regulation have an important role in
    speciation and adaptation is more than 40 years old. With the advent of new
    sequencing technologies, we are able to characterize and study gene
    expression levels and associated regulatory mechanisms in a large number of
    individuals and species at an unprecedented resolution and scale. We have
    thus gained new insights into the evolutionary pressures that shape gene
    expression levels and have developed an appreciation for the relative
    importance of evolutionary changes in different regulatory genetic and
    epigenetic mechanisms. The current challenge is to link gene regulatory
    changes to adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes. Here we mainly focus on
    comparative studies in primates and how they are complemented by studies in
    model organisms.

  abstract: >-
    Reproductive division of labour characterises eusociality. Currently little
    is known about the mechanisms that underlie the ‘sterility’ of the worker
    caste, but queen pheromone plays a major role in regulating the reproductive
    state. Here we investigate oogenesis in the young adult honey bee worker
    ovary in the presence of queen pheromone and in its absence. When queen
    pheromone is absent, workers can activate their ovaries and have
    well-developed follicles. When queen pheromone is present, even though
    workers have non-activated ovaries, they continually produce oocytes which
    are aborted at an early stage. Therefore, irrespective of the presence of
    the queen, the young adult worker ovary contains oocytes. By this means
    young workers retain reproductive plasticity. The degeneration of the germ
    cells in the ovarioles of workers in the presence of queen pheromone has the
    morphological hallmarks of programmed cell death. Therefore the mechanistic
    basis of ‘worker sterility’ relies in part on the regulation of oogenesis
    via programmed cell death. Our results suggest that honey bees have co-opted
    a highly conserved checkpoint at mid-oogenesis to regulate the fertility of
    the worker caste.

    Drosophila offers many advantages as an experimental organism. However, in
    comparison with yeast and mouse, two other widely used eukaryotic model
    systems, Drosophila suffers from an inability to perform homologous
    recombination between introduced DNA and the corresponding chromosomal loci.
    The ability to specifically modify the genomes of yeast and mouse provides a
    quick and easy way to generate or rescue mutations in genes for which a DNA
    clone or sequence is available. A method is described that enables analogous
    manipulations of the Drosophila genome. This technique may also be
    applicable to other organisms for which gene-targeting procedures do not yet
    exist.

    Genetic screens in Drosophila have Lead to the discovery of many genes
    important for patterning and signal transduction in diverse organisms.
    Traditionally, the phenotypic effects of loss-of-function mutations are
    analyzed. As an alternative way to link genes and function, I have developed
    a versatile misexpression screen in Drosophila, the first such screen in
    higher eukaryotes. The screen identifies genes that, when over- or
    misexpressed in a pattern of interest, give a specific phenotype or modulate
    an existing mutant phenotype. It is based on Gal4 transactivation of a
    mobile enhancer and promoter that ”targets” random endogenous genes for
    expression. The modular design of the screen allows directed expression in
    any temporal or spatial pattern. When activated in the developing eye, 4% of
    target inserts gave dominant phenotypes. One insertion was in the gene
    encoding Ras GTPase-activating protein; its overexpression phenotype was
    strongly enhanced by a mutation in Ras1. Thus, biologically relevant
    phenotypes and genetic interactions are identified using this method. The
    screen is a powerful new tool for developmental genetics; similar approaches
    can also be developed for other organisms.

    Serine proteases (SPs) and serine protease homologs (SPHs) constitute the
    second largest family of genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome.
    Eighty-four SPs comprise less than 300 amino acid residues, and a
    significant portion of them are probably digestive enzymes. Some larger SPs
    may contain one or more regions important for protein-protein interactions,
    including clip domains, low-density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats,
    and scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. We identified 37 clusters of
    SP or SPH genes, which probably evolved from relatively recent gene
    duplication and sequence divergence. A majority of the SPs may be
    trypsin-like and activated by cleavage after a specific arginine or lysine
    residue. Among the 147 SPs and 57 SPHs studied, 24 SPs and 13 SPHs contain
    at least one regulatory clip domain. A multiple sequence alignment of the
    clip domains provided further information on structural conservation of
    these regulatory modules. Detailed sequence comparison led to an improved
    classification system for SPs containing clip domains. These analyses have
    established a framework of information about evolutionary relationships
    among the Drosophila SPs and SPHs, which may facilitate research on these
    proteins as well as homologous molecules from other invertebrate species.

    Sequence alignments unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of
    similar and non-similar structure when the pairwise sequence identity is
    high (>40% for long alignments). The signal gets blurred in the twilight
    zone of 20-35% sequence identity. Here, more than a million sequence
    alignments were analysed between protein pairs of known structures to
    re-define a line distinguishing between true and false positives for low
    levels of similarity. Four results stood out. (i) The transition from the
    safe zone of sequence alignment into the twilight zone is described by an
    explosion of false negatives. More than 95% of all pairs detected in the
    twilight zone had different structures. More precisely, above a cut-off
    roughly corresponding to 30% sequence identity, 90% of the pairs were
    homologous; below 25% less than 10% were. (ii) Whether or not sequence
    homology implied structural identity depended crucially on the alignment
    length. For example, if 10 residues were similar in an alignment of length
    16 (>60 %), structural similarity could not be inferred. (iii) The 'more
    similar than identical' rule (discarding all pairs for which percentage
    similarity was lower than percentage identity) reduced false positives
    significantly. (iv) Using intermediate sequences for finding links between
    more distant families was almost as successful: pairs were predicted to be
    homologous when the respective sequence families had proteins in common. All
    findings are applicable to automatic database searches.

    The structural basis for the regioselective hydroxylation of
    Delta-4-3-ketosteroids by human CYP3A4 was investigated. Prior studies had
    suggested that the chemical reactivity of the allylic 6 beta-position might
    have a greater influence than steric constraints by the enzyme. Six highly
    conserved CYP3A residues from substrate recognition site 1 were examined by
    site-directed mutagenesis. F102A and A117L showed no spectrally detectable
    P450. V101G and T103A exhibited a wild-type progesterone metabolite profile.
    Of five mutants at residue N104, only N104D yielded holoenzyme and exhibited
    the same steroid metabolite profile as wild-type. Of four mutants at
    position S119 (A, L, T, V), the three hydrophobic ones produced 2 beta-OH
    rather than 6 beta-OH progesterone or testosterone as the major metabolite.
    Kinetic analysis showed S-50 values similar to wild-type for S119A
    (progesterone) and S119V (testosterone), whereas the V-max values for 2
    beta-hydroxysteroid formation were increased in both cases. All four mutants
    exhibited an altered product profile for 7-hexoxycoumarin side-chain
    hydroxylation, whereas the stimulation of steroid hydroxylation by
    alpha-naphthoflavone was similar to the wild-type. The results indicate that
    the highly conserved residue S119 is a hey determinant of CYP3A4 specificity
    and reveal an important role of the active site topology in steroid 6
    beta-hydroxylation. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

    Here, we compare the evolutionary routes by which bacteria and insects have
    evolved enzymatic processes for the degradation of four classes of synthetic
    chemical insecticide. For insects, the selective advantage of such
    degradative activities is survival on exposure to the insecticide, whereas
    for the bacteria the advantage is simply a matter of access to additional
    sources of nutrients. Nevertheless, bacteria have evolved highly efficient
    enzymes from a wide variety of enzyme families, whereas insects have relied
    upon generalist esterase-, cytochrome P450- and
    glutathione-S-transferase-dependent detoxification systems. Moreover, the
    mutant insect enzymes are less efficient kinetically and less diverged in
    sequence from their putative ancestors than their bacterial counterparts.
    This presumably reflects several advantages that bacteria have over insects
    in the acquisition of new enzymatic functions, such as a broad biochemical
    repertoire from which new functions can be evolved, large population sizes,
    high effective mutation rates, very short generation times and access to
    genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer. Both the insect and
    bacterial systems support recent theory proposing that new biochemical
    functions often evolve from 'promiscuous' activities in existing enzymes,
    with subsequent mutations then enhancing those activities. Study of the
    insect enzymes will help in resistance management, while the bacterial
    enzymes are potential bioremediants of insecticide residues in a range of
    contaminated environments.

    The phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of 39 drosophilid
    species were studied by using the coding region of the Adh gene. Four
    genera–Scaptodrosophila, Zaprionus, Drosophila, and Scaptomyza (from
    Hawaii)–and three Drosophila subgenera–Drosophila, Engiscaptomyza, and
    Sophophora–were included. After conducting statistical analyses of the
    nucleotide sequences of the Adh, Adhr (Adh-related gene), and nuclear rRNA
    genes and a 905-bp segment of mitochondrial DNA, we used Scaptodrosophila as
    the outgroup. The phylogenetic tree obtained showed that the first major
    division of drosophilid species occurs between subgenus Sophophora (genus
    Drosophila) and the group including subgenera Drosophila and Engiscaptomyza
    plus the genera Zaprionus and Scaptomyza. Subgenus Sophophora is then
    divided into D. willistoni and the clade of D. obscura and D. melanogaster
    species groups. In the other major drosophilid group, Zaprionus first
    separates from the other species, and then D. immigrans leaves the remaining
    group of species. This remaining group then splits into the D. repleta group
    and the Hawaiian drosophilid cluster (Hawaiian Drosophila, Engiscaptomyza,
    and Scaptomyza). Engiscaptomyza and Scaptomyza are tightly clustered. Each
    of the D. repleta, D. obscura, and D. melanogaster groups is monophyletic.
    The splitting of subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora apparently occurred
    about 40 Mya, whereas the D. repleta group and the Hawaiian drosophilid
    cluster separated about 32 Mya. By contrast, the splitting of Engiscaptomyza
    and Scaptomyza occurred only about 11 Mya, suggesting that Scaptomyza
    experienced a rapid morphological evolution. The D. obscura and D.
    melanogaster groups apparently diverged about 25 Mya. Many of the D. repleta
    group species studied here have two functional Adh genes (Adh-1 and Adh-2),
    and these duplicated genes can be explained by two duplication events.

    Insects have an enormous impact on global public health as disease vectors
    and as agricultural enablers as well as pests and olfaction is an important
    sensory input to their behavior. As such it is of great value to understand
    the interplay of the molecular components of the olfactory system which, in
    addition to fostering a better understanding of insect neurobiology, may
    ultimately aid in devising novel intervention strategies to reduce disease
    transmission or crop damage. Since the first discovery of odorant receptors
    in vertebrates over a decade ago, much of our view on how the insect
    olfactory system might work has been derived from observations made in
    vertebrates and other invertebrates, such as lobsters or nematodes. Together
    with the advantages of a wide range of genetic tools, the identification of
    the first insect odorant receptors in Drosophila melanogaster in 1999 paved
    the way for rapid progress in unraveling the question of how olfactory
    signal transduction and processing occurs in the fruitfly. This review
    intends to summarize much of this progress and to point out some areas where
    advances can be expected in the near future.

    The P-element has been the workhorse of Drosophila genetics since it was
    developed as a tool for transgenesis in 1982; the subsequent development of
    a variety of systems based on the transposon have provided a range of
    powerful and flexible tools for genetics and genomics applications.
    P-element insertions are frequently used as starting-points for generating
    chromosomal deletions to remove flanking genes, either by screening for
    imprecise excision events or by selecting for male recombination events.
    Elements that utilise the yeast FLP/FLP recombination target (FRT)
    site-specific recombination system have been widely used to generate
    molecularly marked mitotic clones for mosaic analysis, extending the reach
    of this powerful genetic tool to virtually all areas of developmental
    biology. P-elements are still widely used as traditional mutagenesis
    reagents and form the backbone of projects aimed at generating insertions in
    every predicted gene in the fly genome. In addition, vectors based on the
    FLP/FRT system are being used for genome-wide applications, including the
    development of molecularly-mapped deletion and duplication kits. In addition
    to these 'traditional' genetic approaches, a variety of engineered elements
    have been developed for a wide range of transgenic applications, including
    enhancer trapping, gene-tagging, targeted misexpression, RNA interference
    (RNAi) delivery and homologous recombination/gene replacement. To complement
    the use of P-elements, alternative transposon vectors have been developed.
    The most widely used of these are the lepidopteran element piggyBac and a
    Drosophila hydei transposon, Minos. In total, a range of transposon vectors
    offers the Drosophila biologist considerable flexibility and sophistication
    in manipulating the genome of the fly and has allowed rapid advances in all
    areas of developmental biology and genome science.

  abstract: >-
    Expression of genes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) beyond its protein
    folding capacity activates signaling pathways that are collectively referred
    to as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). A major branch of the UPR pathway
    is mediated by IRE1, an ER-tethered endonuclease. Upon ER stress-induced
    activation, IRE1 splices the mRNA of XBP1, thereby generating an active
    isoform of this transcription factor. During normal Drosophila development,
    tissues with high protein secretory load show signs of IRE1/XBP1 activity
    indicative of inherent ER stress associated with those cell types. Here, we
    report that the XBP1 promoter activity itself is enhanced in secretory
    tissues of Drosophila, and it can be induced by excessive ER stress.
    Specifically, we developed a Drosophila XBP1 transcription reporter by
    placing dsRed under the control of the XBP1 intergenic sequence. DsRed
    expression in these xbp1p>dsRed transgenic flies showed patterns similar to
    that of xbp1 transcript distribution. In healthy developing flies, the
    reporter expression was highest in salivary glands and the intestine. In the
    adult, the male reproductive organs showed high levels of dsRed. These
    tissues are known to have high protein secretory load. Consistently, the
    xbp1p>dsRed reporter was induced by excessive ER stress caused by mutant
    Rhodopsin-1 overexpression. These results suggest that secretory cells
    suffer from inherent ER stress, and the xbp1p>dsRed flies provide a useful
    tool in studying the function and homeostasis of those cells.

  abstract: >-
    In much of the tropics and subtropics, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown under
    long days (LDs). Therefore, LD must play a major role in inducing flowering
    signal in rice. However, little is known on LD-dependent flowering signal in
    the species. We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly
    homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for
    flowering. However, its detailed photoperiodic mechanism was not yet
    elucidated. Here, we report the functional analysis of OsMADS50 and its
    closely related gene OsMADS56. Knock-out of OsMADS50 caused a late-flowering
    phenotype only under LD conditions. Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also
    resulted in delayed flowering under LD. In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX
    transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although
    that of OsLFL1 increased. On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1,
    OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged. These observations imply
    that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in
    regulating LD-dependent flowering. Yeast two-hybrid and
    co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated an interaction between those two
    proteins as well as their formation of homodimers. These results suggest
    that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 may form a complex that regulates downstream
    target genes.

  abstract: >-
    Up-regulation of detoxifying enzymes in insecticide-resistant strains of the
    house fly is a common mechanism for metabolic resistance. However, the
    molecular basis of this increased insecticide metabolism is not well
    understood. In the multiresistant Rutgers strain, several cytochromes P450
    and glutathione S-transferases are constitutively overexpressed at the
    transcriptional level. Overexpression is the result of trans-regulation, and
    a regulatory gene has been located on chromosome 2. A Gly137 to Asp point
    mutation in αE7 esterase gene, leading to the loss of carboxylesterase
    activity, has been associated with organophosphate resistance in the house
    fly and the sheep blowfly. We show here that purified recombinant CYP6A1 is
    able to detoxify diazinon with a high efficiency. We also show that either
    the Gly137 to Asp point mutation in αE7 esterase gene or a deletion at this
    locus confer resistance and overproduction of the CYP6A1 protein. Based on
    these findings, we propose it is the absence of the wild-type Gly137 allele
    of the αE7 gene that releases the transcriptional repression of genes coding
    for detoxification enzymes such as CYP6A1, thereby leading to metabolic
    resistance to diazinon.

    Starting in 2003, numerous studies using culture-independent methodologies
    to characterize the gut microbiota of honey bees have retrieved a consistent
    and distinctive set of eight bacterial species, based on near identity of
    the 16S rRNA gene sequences. A recent study [Mattila HR, Rios D,
    Walker-Sperling VE, Roeselers G, Newton ILG (2012) Characterization of the
    active microbiotas associated with honey bees reveals healthier and broader
    communities when colonies are genetically diverse. PLoS ONE 7(3): e32962],
    using pyrosequencing of the V1–V2 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene,
    reported finding entirely novel bacterial species in honey bee guts, and
    used taxonomic assignments from these reads to predict metabolic activities
    based on known metabolisms of cultivable species. To better understand this
    discrepancy, we analyzed the Mattila et al. pyrotag dataset. In contrast to
    the conclusions of Mattila et al., we found that the large majority of
    pyrotag sequences belonged to clusters for which representative sequences
    were identical to sequences from previously identified core species of the
    bee microbiota. On average, they represent 95% of the bacteria in each
    worker bee in the Mattila et al. dataset, a slightly lower value than that
    found in other studies. Some colonies contain small proportions of other
    bacteria, mostly species of Enterobacteriaceae. Reanalysis of the Mattila et
    al. dataset also did not support a relationship between abundances of
    Bifidobacterium and of putative pathogens or a significant difference in gut
    communities between colonies from queens that were singly or multiply mated.
    Additionally, consistent with previous studies, the dataset supports the
    occurrence of considerable strain variation within core species, even within
    single colonies. The roles of these bacteria within bees, or the
    implications of the strain variation, are not yet clear.

  abstract: >-
    While the number of sequenced diploid genomes of interest have been steadily
    increasing in the last few years, assembly of highly polymorphic (HP)
    diploid genomes remains challenging. As a result, there is shortage of tools
    for assembling HP genomes from NGS data. The initial approaches to
    assembling HP genomes were proposed in the pre-NGS era and are not well
    suited for NGS projects. We present the first de Bruijn graph assembler
    dipSPAdes for HP genomes and demonstrate that it significantly improves on
    the state-of-the-art in the HP genome assembly.

  abstract: >-
    Ultraviolet-B light (UV-B) regulates the expression of genes in a
    wavelength- and fluence rate-dependent fashion. A signaling pathway
    consisting of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1) and UV RESISTANCE
    LOCUS 8 (UVR 8) mediates responsiveness to longer wavelength, low intensity
    UV-B light-activating, for example, HY5 gene expression. By contrast,
    transcription of another group of genes, including ANAC13, modulated by
    shorter wavelength, higher intensity UV-B is controlled by a yet unknown and
    largely COP1-independent signaling cascade. Here we provide evidence by
    promoter deletion analysis, and characterization of genetic mutants
    displaying aberrant expression patterns, that two cis-regulatory elements,
    designated MRE(ANAC13) and UVBox(ANAC13), are required for maximal UV-B
    induction of the ANAC13 gene in transgenic plants. These elements are
    located in the proximal 150-bp region of the ANAC13 promoter. They show no
    significant similarity to each other; the putative MRE(ANAC13) (-AACCTT-) is
    closely related to MRE(CHS) (-AACCTA-) found in the CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS)
    gene, whereas UVBox(ANAC13) (with core sequence CAAG) represents a novel
    cis-regulatory element. The novel UVBox(ANAC13) sequence is significantly
    enriched in the promoter region of a subset of UV-B-induced genes with
    similar activation properties as ANAC13. In addition, we demonstrate that
    expression of a chimeric gene containing only the dimerized 12-mer
    containing UVBox(ANAC13) fused to a minimal CaMV35S promoter/luciferase
    reporter is (i) efficiently induced by shorter wavelength, higher intensity
    UV-B, but (ii) does not respond either to longer wavelength UV-B and red
    light or (iii) to abscisic acid treatment and osmotic, salt, heat and cold
    stresses.

  abstract: >-
    <p>Oxford Nanopore (ONT) is a leading long-read technology which has been
    revolutionizing transcriptome analysis through its capacity to sequence the
    majority of transcripts from end-to-end. This has greatly increased our
    ability to study the diversity of transcription mechanisms such as
    transcription initiation, termination, and alternative splicing. However,
    ONT still suffers from high error rates which have thus far limited it scope
    to reference-based analyses. When a reference is not available or is not a
    viable option due to reference-bias, error correction is a crucial step
    towards the reconstruction of the sequenced transcripts and downstream
    sequence analysis of transcripts. In this paper, we present a novel
    computational method to error-correct ONT cDNA sequencing data, called
    isONcorrect. IsONcorrect is able to jointly use all isoforms from a gene
    during error correction, thereby allowing it to correct reads at low
    sequencing depths. We are able to obtain an accuracy of 98.7-99.5%,
    demonstrating the feasibility of applying cost-effective cDNA full
    transcript length sequencing for reference-free transcriptome analysis.</p>

  abstract: >-
    A probit analysis method is presented for the analysis of preference data
    from a behavioural assay of animals, where responses were observed as
    animals' choice between the treatment and control sides or areas. Standard
    probit models designed for all or nothing phenomena are not applicable to
    preference assays, because a log dose metameter only indirectly correlates
    with the choice. The present method enabled analysis by regressing the
    probit transformation of the proportion of net responders, expressed in a
    preference model equation, on a log dose metameter. The computer program
    includes the maximization routine of the log-likelihood function, a test of
    homogeneity and a calculation of potency with fiducial limits. After the
    explanation of the basic model, as well as generalized regression models
    including the parameters of natural preference and immunity, a computer
    output demonstrated the analysis of an olfactometer assay on two cockroach
    attractants by reporting statistics. By comparing differently generalized
    models for fitness to the data, a preferable experimental design was
    formulated.

    The FoxO family of Forkhead transcription factors functions at the interface
    of tumor suppression, energy metabolism, and organismal longevity. FoxO
    factors are key downstream targets of insulin, growth factor, nutrient, and
    oxidative stress stimuli that coordinate a wide range of cellular outputs.
    FoxO-dependent cellular responses include gluconeogenesis, neuropeptide
    secretion, atrophy, autophagy, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and stress
    resistance. This review will discuss the roles of the mammalian FoxO family
    in a variety of cell types, from stem cells to mature cells, in the context
    of the whole organism. Given the overwhelming evidence that the FoxO factors
    promote longevity in invertebrates, this review will also discuss the
    potential role of the FoxO factors in the aging of mammalian organisms.

  abstract: >-
    Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a
    comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across
    the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work
    reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of
    the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial
    ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to
    be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata,
    Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable
    proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists
    that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and
    generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species
    is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are
    occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic
    insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are
    replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within
    agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear
    to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive
    agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic
    pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and
    introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is
    particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of
    species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A
    rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious
    reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable,
    ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current
    trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the
    vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation
    technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural
    and urban environments.

    Prosthetic joint infections are clinically difficult to diagnose and treat.

    techniques. Nanopore sequencing offers advantages in speed of detection over
    MiSeq. Here, we report a real-time analytical pathway for Nanopore sequence

    The final steps in the pheromone-biosynthetic pathway of the pine engraver
    beetle, Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) are unknown, but likely
    involve myrcene (7-methyl-3-methylene-1,6-octadiene) hydroxylation to
    produce the aggregation pheromone component, ipsdienol
    (2-methyl-6-methylene-2,7-octadien-4-ol). We have isolated a full-length L
    pini cDNA encoding a cytochrome P450, CYP9T2. The recovered cDNA is 1.83 kb
    and the open reading frame encodes a 532 amino acid protein. CYP9T2 is
    regulated by the same physiological factors that induce pheromone
    production. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments showed that feeding on
    host phloem induced CYP9T2 expression in males, but not females, and that
    basal expression levels are highest in male midguts, similar to other I pini
    pheromone-biosynthetic genes. Microsomes prepared from Sf9 cells
    co-expressing baculoviral-mediated recombinant CYP9T2 and housefly (Musca
    domestica) NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase converted myrcene to ipsdienol.
    The product identified by coupled GC-MS was mostly (4R)-(-)-ipsdienol, an
    important aggregation pheromone component for western North American I.
    pini. These results are consistent with CYP9T2 encoding a myrcene
    hydroxylase that functions near the end of the pheromone-biosynthetic
    pathway. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    Myrcene (7-methyl-3-methylene-1,6-octadiene) hydroxylation is likely one of
    the final reactions involved in the production of the Ips spp. (Coleoptera:
    Scolytidae) aggregation pheromone components, ipsdienol
    (2-methyl-6-methylene-2,7-octadien-4-ol) and ipsenol
    (2-methyl-6-methylene-7-octen-4-ol). To gain insight into the evolution of
    pheromone production, we isolated a full-length cDNA from the pinyon ips,
    Ips confusus (LeConte), that encodes a pheromone-biosynthetic cytochrome
    P450, I. confusus CYP9T1 (IcCYP9T1). The recovered cDNA is 1.70 kb, and the
    open reading frame encodes a 532 amino acid protein. IcCYP9T1 is 94%
    identical to the pine engraver, Ips pini (Say), CYP9T2 ortholog that
    hydroxylates myrcene. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments showed that
    IcCYP9T1, as does CYP9T2, has an expression pattern similar to other
    pheromone-biosynthetic genes in I. pini. Basal expression levels were higher
    in males than females, and expression was significantly induced in male, but
    not in female, anterior midguts by feeding on host phloem. Microsomes,
    prepared from Sf9 cells co-expressing baculoviral-mediated recombinant
    IcCYP9T1 and house fly (Musca domestica) NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase,
    converted myrcene to 85%-(R)-(-)-ipsdienol. These results are consistent
    with IcCYP9T1 encoding a myrcene hydroxylase that functions near the end of
    the pheromone-biosynthetic pathway. Since the I. confusus pheromone blend
    contains > 90%-(S)-(+)-ipsdienol, these results confirm further that Ips
    spp. myrcene hydroxylases do not control the final ipsdienol enantiomeric
    blend. Other enzymes are required following myrcene hydroxylation to achieve
    the critical quantity and enantiomeric composition of pheromonal ipsenol and
    ipsdienol used by different Ips spp.

  abstract: >-
    Considerable insights were recently gained into the history and process of
    rice domestication. It becomes increasingly clear that artificial and
    natural selections coupled with extensive introgression have shaped the
    genomes of cultivated rice. The interplay of these evolutionary forces gave
    rise to the cultivated species, Oryza sativa, with divergent genomic
    backgrounds from two wild species, O. rufipogon and O. nivara, governed by a
    set of domestication alleles which had originated primarily at one location
    of initial cultivation. The mechanistic understanding of domestication
    suggests that the combination of quantitative trait locus mapping,
    genome-wide association study, and genome scan will be effective means for
    discovering potentially valuable alleles from the cultivated and wild
    species. The accumulation and appropriate sampling of germplasm collections
    for these analyses should effectively grow the useful allele pool, which
    combined with molecular breeding may get to a point literally triggering the
    re-domestication of rice varieties for sustainable food production.

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases play a significant role in the detoxification
    of hostplant allelochemicals and synthetic insecticides in Lepidoptera. In
    the corn earworm Helicoverpa zea, a noctuid of considerable economic
    importance, metabolisms of xanthotoxin, a toxic furanocoumarin, and
    alpha-cypermethrin, an insecticide, are mediated by at least one P450 with a
    catalytic site capable of accepting both substrates. To further the
    characterization of P450s in this species, we have cloned three full-length
    cDNAs encoding two CYP4M subfamily members and a novel CYP321A subfamily
    member. RNA analyses have demonstrated that the CYP321A1 gene is highly
    induced (51-fold) in larval midguts in response to xanthotoxin but not
    cypermethrin. Both CYP4M genes are expressed at negligible levels that are
    not increased by xanthotoxin or cypermethrin. Baculovirus-mediated
    expression of the full-length CYP321A1 cDNA has demonstrated that the
    CYP321A1 protein metabolizes xanthotoxin and angelicin, like the CYP6B1
    protein in the furanocoumarin specialist Papilio polyxenes, and
    alpha-cypermethrin, like the CYP6B8 protein previously characterized in H.
    zea. In contrast, the CYP4M7 protein does not metabolize xanthotoxin at any
    detectable level. We conclude that at least two xanthotoxin-inducible P450s
    from highly divergent subfamilies (CYP6B and CYP321A) contribute to the
    resistance of H. zea larvae to toxic furanocoumarins and insecticides.
    Genomic PCR analysis indicates that the CYP321A1 gene has evolved
    independently from the CYP6B genes known to be present in this insect. (C)

    BACKGROUND:Plant growth depends on synergistic interactions between internal
    and external signals, and yield potential of crops is a manifestation of how
    these complex factors interact, particularly at critical stages of
    development. As an initial step towards developing a systems-level
    understanding of the biological processes underlying the expression of
    overall agronomic potential in cereal crops, a high-resolution transcriptome
    analysis of rice was conducted throughout life cycle of rice grown under
    natural field conditions. RESULTS:A wide range of gene expression profiles
    based on 48 organs and tissues at various developmental stages identified
    731 organ/tissue specific genes as well as 215 growth stage-specific
    expressed genes universally in leaf blade, leaf sheath, and root. Continuous
    transcriptome profiling of leaf from transplanting until harvesting further
    elucidated the growth-stage specificity of gene expression and uncovered two
    major drastic changes in the leaf transcriptional program. The first major
    change occurred before the panicle differentiation, accompanied by the
    expression of RFT1, a putative florigen gene in long day conditions, and the
    downregulation of the precursors of two microRNAs. This transcriptome change
    was also associated with physiological alterations including
    phosphate-homeostasis state as evident from the behavior of several key
    regulators such as miR399. The second major transcriptome change occurred
    just after flowering, and based on analysis of sterile mutant lines, we
    further revealed that the formation of strong sink, i.e., a developing
    grain, is not the major cause but is rather a promoter of this change.
    CONCLUSIONS:Our study provides not only the genetic basis for functional
    genomics in rice but also new insight into understanding the critical
    physiological processes involved in flowering and seed development, that
    could lead to novel strategies for optimizing crop productivity.

    In many eukaryotic organisms including plants, homeobox genes are thought to
    be master regulators that establish the cellular or regional identities and
    specify the fundamental body plan. We isolated and characterized a cDNA
    designated OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15) that encodes a KNOTTED-type
    homeodomain protein. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the OSH15 cDNA
    showed a dramatically altered morphological phenotype caused by disturbance
    of specific aspects of tobacco development, thereby indicating the
    involvement of OSH15 in plant development. We analyzed the in situ mRNA
    localization of OSH15 through the whole plant life cycle, comparing the
    expression pattern with that of another rice homeobox gene, OSH1. In early
    embryogenesis, both genes were expressed as the same pattern at a region
    where the shoot apical meristem would develop later. In late embryogenesis,
    the expression pattern of the two genes became different. Whereas the
    expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15
    expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in
    a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs. This
    pattern of expression was similar to that observed around vegetative or
    reproductive shoots, or the floral meristem in mature plants. RNA in situ
    localization data suggest that OSH15 may play roles in the shoot
    organization during early embryogenesis and thereafter, OSH15 may be
    involved in morphogenetic events around the shoot apical meristem.

    The plant hormone, auxin, regulates many aspects of growth and development.
    Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of
    auxin are largely unknown. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the
    primary responses to auxin, we analyzed the expression of genes in
    Arabidopsis seedlings treated with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for 15 min. We
    identified a single gene that is downregulated early, and 29 genes that are
    upregulated early. Several types of typical transcription factors are
    identified as early upregulated genes, suggesting that auxin signals are
    mediated by a master set of diverse transcriptional regulators. Of the genes
    that responded to auxin, the expression of the homeobox gene, HAT2, was
    induced rapidly. Furthermore, we show that the expression of HAT2 is induced
    by auxin, but not by other phytohormones. To analyze the function of HAT2 in
    the plant's response to auxin, we generated 35S::HAT2 transgenic plants.
    These produced long hypocotyls, epinastic cotyledons, long petioles, and
    small leaves, which are characteristic of the phenotypes of the
    auxin-overproducing mutants, superroot1 (sur1) and superroot2 (sur2). On the
    other hand, 35S::HAT2 plants showed reduced lateral root elongation, and
    reduced auxin sensitivity compared to wild-type plants. Together with the
    results of RNA blotting and biochemical analyses, these findings suggest
    that HAT2 plays opposite roles in the shoot and root tissues in regulating
    auxin-mediated morphogenesis.

  abstract: >-
    A whole- genome duplication occurred in a shared ancestor of the yeast
    species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces castellii and Candida
    glabrata. Here we trace the subsequent losses of duplicated genes, and show
    that the pattern of loss differs among the three species at 20% of all loci.
    For example, several transcription factor genes, including STE12, TEC1, TUP1
    and MCM1, are single-copy in S. cerevisiae but are retained in duplicate in
    S. castellii and C. glabrata. At many loci, different species have lost
    different members of a duplicated gene pair, so that 4 - 7% of single- copy
    genes compared between any two species are not orthologues. This pattern of
    gene loss provides strong evidence for speciation through a version of the
    Bateson - Dobzhansky - Muller mechanism, in which the loss of alternative
    copies of duplicated genes leads to reproductive isolation(1,2). We show
    that the lineages leading to the three species diverged shortly after the
    whole-genome duplication, during a period of precipitous gene loss. The set
    of loci at which single- copy paralogues are retained is biased towards
    genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and genes that evolve slowly,
    consistent with the hypothesis that reciprocal gene loss is more likely to
    occur between duplicated genes that are functionally indistinguishable. We
    propose a simple, unified model in which a single mechanism - passive gene
    loss - enabled whole- genome duplication and led to the rapid emergence of
    new yeast species.

    Although Drosophila melanogaster is a paradigm eukaryote for biology,
    relationships of this species and the other 174 species in the melanogaster
    species group are poorly explored and ambiguous. Gene regions of Cytochrome
    oxidase II (mt:CoII), Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and hunchback (hb) were
    sequenced and analysed phylogenetically to test prior hypotheses of
    relationships for the group based on chromosomes, morphology, and 28S rRNA
    gene sequences. A simultaneous cladistic analysis of the three newly
    sequenced gene regions produced a single well-resolved phylogeny for 49
    exemplar species representing eight subgroups. Monophyly of each of the
    ananassae, melanogaster, montium, and takahashii subgroups is supported; the
    suzukii subgroup is polyphyletic. This phylogeny is consistent with
    variation in significant morphological structures, such as the male sex comb
    on the fore tarsus. The broad range of morphological variation among these
    species is interpreted and the applicability to evolution and developmental
    investigations is discussed. This phylogeny facilitates comparative
    investigations, such as gene family evolution, transposable element
    transmission, and evolution of morphological structures. (C) 2002 The

    Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that control
    processes ranging from the maintenance of cell fate decisions and stem cell
    pluripotency in animals to the control of flowering time in
    plants1,2,3,4,5,6. In Drosophila, genetic studies identified more than 15
    different PcG proteins that are required to repress homeotic (HOX) and other
    developmental regulator genes in cells where they must stay inactive1,7,8.
    Biochemical analyses established that these PcG proteins exist in distinct
    multiprotein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin of target
    genes1,2,3,4. Among those, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the
    related dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex contain an E3 ligase
    activity for monoubiquitination of histone H2A (refs 1–4). Here we show that
    the uncharacterized Drosophila PcG gene calypso encodes the ubiquitin
    carboxy-terminal hydrolase BAP1. Biochemically purified Calypso exists in a
    complex with the PcG protein ASX, and this complex, named Polycomb
    repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), is bound at PcG target genes in
    Drosophila. Reconstituted recombinant Drosophila and human PR-DUB complexes
    remove monoubiquitin from H2A but not from H2B in nucleosomes. Drosophila
    mutants lacking PR-DUB show a strong increase in the levels of
    monoubiquitinated H2A. A mutation that disrupts the catalytic activity of
    Calypso, or absence of the ASX subunit abolishes H2A deubiquitination in
    vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus
    entail a dynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination by PRC1 and dRAF, and
    H2A deubiquitination by PR-DUB.

  abstract: "Summary\nUnderstanding the molecular programs that guide differentiation during development is a major challenge. Here, we introduce Waddington-OT, an approach for studying developmental time courses to infer ancestor-descendant fates and model the\_regulatory programs that underlie them. We apply\_the method to reconstruct the landscape of\_reprogramming from 315,000 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles, collected at half-day intervals across 18\_days. The results reveal a wider range of developmental programs than previously characterized. Cells gradually adopt either a terminal stromal state or a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition state. The latter gives rise to populations related to pluripotent, extra-embryonic, and neural cells, with each harboring multiple finer subpopulations. The analysis predicts transcription factors and paracrine signals that affect fates and experiments validate\_that the TF Obox6 and the cytokine GDF9 enhance reprogramming efficiency. Our approach sheds light on the process and outcome of reprogramming and provides a framework applicable to diverse temporal processes in biology."

    The Drosophila serrata species complex from Australia and New Guinea has
    been widely used in evolutionary studies of speciation and climatic
    adaptation. It is believed to consist of D. serrata, D. birchii and D.
    dominicana, although knowledge of the latter is limited. Here we present
    evidence for a previously undescribed cryptic member of the D. serrata
    species complex. This new cryptic species is widespread in far north
    Queensland, Australia and is likely to have been previously mistaken for D.
    serrata. It shows complete reproductive isolation when crossed with both D.
    serrata and D. birchii. The cryptic species can be easily distinguished from
    D. serrata and D. birchii using either microsatellite loci or visual
    techniques. Although it occurs sympatrically with both D. serrata and D.
    birchii, it differs from these species in development time, viability, wing
    size and wing morphology. Its discovery explains patterns of recently
    described mitochondrial DNA divergence within D. serrata, and may also help
    to clarify some ambiguities evident in early evolutionary literature on
    reproductive incompatibility within the D. serrata species complex.

  abstract: >-
    We know little about several important properties of beneficial mutations,
    including their mutational origin, their phenotypic effects(e.g., protein
    structure changes vs. regulatory changes), and the frequency and rapidity
    with which they become fixed in a population. One signature of the spread of
    beneficial mutations is the reduction of heterozygosity at linked sites.
    Here, we present population genetic data from several loci across chromosome
    arm 2R in Drosophila simulans. A 100-kb segment from a freely recombining
    region of this chromosome shows extremely reduced heterozygosity in a
    California population sample, yet typical levels of divergence between
    species, suggesting that at least one episode of strong directional
    selection has occurred in the region. The 5' flanking sequence of one gene
    in this region, Cyp6g1 (a cytochrome P450), is nearly fixed for a Doc
    transposable element insertion. Presence of the insertion is correlated with
    increased transcript abundance of Cyp6g1, a phenotype previously shown to be
    associated with insecticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. Surveys
    of nucleotide variation in the same genomic region in an African D. simulans
    population revealed no evidence for a high-frequency Doc element and no
    evidence for reduced polymorphism. These data are consistent with the notion
    that the Doc element is a geographically restricted beneficial mutation.
    Data from D. simulans Cyp6g1 are paralleled in many respects by data from
    its sister species D. melanogaster.

  abstract: >-
    The increased transcription of the Cyp6g1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster,
    and consequent resistance to insecticides such as DDT, is a widely cited
    example of adaptation mediated by cis-regulatory change. A fragment of an
    Accord transposable element inserted upstream of the Cyp6g1 gene is causally
    associated with resistance and has spread to high frequencies in populations
    around the world since the 1940s. Here we report the existence of a natural
    allelic series at this locus of D. melanogaster, involving copy number
    variation of Cyp6g1, and two additional transposable element insertions (a P
    and an HMS-Beagle). We provide evidence that this genetic variation
    underpins phenotypic variation, as the more derived the allele, the greater
    the level of DDT resistance. Tracking the spatial and temporal patterns of
    allele frequency changes indicates that the multiple steps of the allelic
    series are adaptive. Further, a DDT association study shows that the most
    resistant allele, Cyp6g1-[BP], is greatly enriched in the top 5% of the
    phenotypic distribution and accounts for ∼16% of the underlying phenotypic
    variation in resistance to DDT. In contrast, copy number variation for
    another candidate resistance gene, Cyp12d1, is not associated with
    resistance. Thus the Cyp6g1 locus is a major contributor to DDT resistance
    in field populations, and evolution at this locus features multiple adaptive
    steps occurring in rapid succession.

    The effects of serum on the expression of four commonly used housekeeping
    genes were examined in serum-stimulated fibroblasts in order to validate the
    internal control genes for a quantitative RT-PCR assay. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts
    transfected with an inducible chimeric gene were serum-starved for 24 h and
    then induced with 15% serum for 8 h. Serum did not alter the amount of total
    RNA that was expressed in the cells, however, the amount of mRNA
    significantly increased over time with serum-stimulation. Both messenger and
    total RNA from each of the time points were reverse transcribed under two
    different conditions; one in which the reactions were normalized to contain
    equal amounts of RNA and another series of reactions that were not
    normalized to RNA content. The resulting cDNA was amplified by real-time,
    quantitative PCR using gene-specific primers for beta -actin, beta -2
    microglobulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 18S
    ribosomal RNA. The expression of beta -actin and GAPDH increased up to nine-
    and three-fold, respectively, under all conditions of reverse transcription
    (P < 0.01). The expression of 18S rRNA increased with serum-stimulation when
    the cDNA synthesized from non-normalized, total RNA was assayed (P < 0.01)
    but not when the reverse transcriptions were normalized to RNA content (P >
    0.05). The expression of beta -2 microglobulin increased up to two-fold when
    assayed from cDNA synthesized from non-normalized mRNA, but was unaffected
    by serum when the reverse transcriptions were normalized to mRNA. beta -2
    Microglobulin expression was found to be directly proportional to the amount
    of mRNA that was present in non-normalized reverse transcription reactions.
    Thus, beta -2 microglobulin and 18S rRNA are suitable internal control genes
    in quantitative serum-stimulation studies, while beta -actin and GAPDH are
    not. The internal control gene needs to be properly validated when designing
    quantitative gene expression studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

    The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has become such a popular model
    organism for studying human disease that it is often described as a little
    person with wings. This view has been strengthened with the sequencing of
    the Drosophila genome and the discovery that 60% of human disease genes have
    homologues in the fruitfly. In this review, I discuss the approach of using
    Drosophila not only as a model for metazoans in general but as a model
    insect in particular. Specifically, I discuss recent work on the use of
    Drosophila to study the transmission of disease by insect vectors and to
    investigate insecticide function and development.

    Due to the rapid release of new data from genome sequencing projects, the
    majority of protein sequences in public databases have not been
    experimentally characterized; rather, sequences are annotated using
    computational analysis. The level of misannotation and the types of
    misannotation in large public databases are currently unknown and have not
    been analyzed in depth. We have investigated the misannotation levels for
    molecular function in four public protein sequence databases
    (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, GenBank NR, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, and KEGG) for a model
    set of 37 enzyme families for which extensive experimental information is
    available. The manually curated database Swiss-Prot shows the lowest
    annotation error levels (close to 0% for most families); the two other
    protein sequence databases (GenBank NR and TrEMBL) and the protein sequences
    in the KEGG pathways database exhibit similar and surprisingly high levels
    of misannotation that average 5%-63% across the six superfamilies studied.
    For 10 of the 37 families examined, the level of misannotation in one or
    more of these databases is >80%. Examination of the NR database over time
    shows that misannotation has increased from 1993 to 2005. The types of
    misannotation that were found fall into several categories, most associated
    with "overprediction" of molecular function. These results suggest that
    misannotation in enzyme superfamilies containing multiple families that
    catalyze different reactions is a larger problem than has been recognized.
    Strategies are suggested for addressing some of the systematic problems
    contributing to these high levels of misannotation.

  abstract: >-
    Plant systems utilize a diverse array of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases
    (P450s) in their biosynthetic and detoxicative pathways. Those P450s in
    biosynthetic pathways play critical roles in the synthesis of lignins, UV
    protectants, pigments, defense compounds, fatty acids, hormones, and
    signaling molecules. Those in catabolic pathways participate in the
    breakdown of endogenous compounds and toxic compounds encountered in the
    environment. Because of their roles in this wide diversity of metabolic
    processes, plant P450 proteins and transcripts can serve as downstream
    reporters for many different biochemical pathways responding to chemical,
    developmental, and environmental cues. This review focuses initially on
    defining P450 biochemistries, nomenclature systems, and the relationships
    between genes in the extended P450 superfamily that exists in all plant
    species. Subsequently, it focuses on outlining the many approaches being
    used to assign function to individual P450 proteins and gene loci. The
    examples of assigned P450 activities that are spread throughout this review
    highlight the importance of understanding and utilizing P450 sequences as
    markers for linking biochemical pathway responses to physiological
    processes.

  abstract: >-
    Over evolutionary time, insect herbivores have adapted to the presence of
    natural toxins and more recently to synthetic insecticides in or on the
    plants they consume. Biochemical analyses and molecular modeling of the
    cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) that metabolize these compounds have
    provided insight into the many variations affecting their catalytic
    activity. Phylogenetically distinct P450s may metabolize similar substrates,
    and phylogenetically similar P450s may metabolize different substrates; as
    well, some P450s process broad arrays of both phytochemicals and synthetic
    insecticides, while closely related P450s are restricted to a narrow range
    of phytochemicals. Mapped on the predicted three-dimensional structures of
    insect P450s developed from available mammalian P450 crystal structures,
    differences in multiple regions of the insect proteins reveal the
    evolutionary processes occurring as P450 genes have duplicated and diverged.
    Analyses of site-directed mutants in select lepidopteran and dipteran P450s
    demonstrate that slight changes in the catalytic site, the putative product
    release channel, and the proximal surface (interacting with electron
    transfer partners such as cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5) yield
    pronounced activity differences. Additionally, changes in the catalytic site
    and in the linker region preceding the proline-hinge influence P450 folding.
    With predicted structures available for many mammalian P450s involved in
    metabolism of xenobiotics, it is possible to record allelic variation
    relative to catalytically important regions in the overall P450 structure
    and to predict functionally critical differences. Together with information
    on the relative levels of allelic variant transcripts, comprehensive
    characterization of the mechanisms that modulate metabolism of natural and
    synthetic xenobiotics in insects can yield insights into plant-insect
    coevolution and into novel approaches for chemical pest management.

    MOTIVATION:Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster
    structures in high-dimensional datasets, such as those obtained in DNA
    microarray and quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main
    limitations is the lack of a computationally fast method to set optimal
    values of algorithm parameters. Wrong parameter values may either lead to
    the inclusion of purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore
    potentially important data. The optimal solution has parameter values for
    which the clustering does not yield any results for a purely random dataset
    but which detects cluster formation with maximum resolution on the edge of
    randomness. RESULTS:Estimation of the optimal parameter values is achieved
    by evaluation of the results of the clustering procedure applied to
    randomized datasets. In this case, the optimal value of the fuzzifier
    follows common rules that depend only on the main properties of the dataset.
    Taking the dimension of the set and the number of objects as input values
    instead of evaluating the entire dataset allows us to propose a functional
    relationship determining the fuzzifier directly. This result speaks strongly
    against using a predefined fuzzifier as typically done in many previous
    studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation of the
    optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance
    between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or
    better than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.

  abstract: >-
    The cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases (monooxygenases) are an
    extremely important metabolic system involved in the catabolism and
    anabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Monooxygenase-mediated
    metabolism is a common mechanism by which insects become resistant to
    insecticides;as evidenced by the numerous insect species and insecticides
    affected. This review begins by presenting background information about
    P450s, the role of monooxygenases in insects, and the different techniques
    that have been used to isolate individual insect P450s. Next, insecticide
    resistance is briefly described, and then historical information about
    monooxygenase-mediated insecticide resistance is reviewed. For any case of
    monooxygenase-mediated resistance, identification of the P450(s) involved,
    out of the dozens that are present in an insect, has proven very
    challenging. Therefore, the next section of the review focuses on the
    minimal criteria for establishing that a P450 is involved in resistance.
    This is followed by a comprehensive examination of the literature concerning
    the individual P450s that have been isolated from insecticide resistant
    strains. In each case, the history of the strain and the evidence for
    monooxygenase-mediated resistance are reviewed. The isolation and
    characterization of the P450(s) from the strain are then described, and the
    evidence of whether or not the isolated P450(s) is involved in resistance is
    summarized. The remainder of the review summarizes our current knowledge of
    the molecular basis of monooxygenase-mediated resistance and the
    implications for the future. The importance of these studies for development
    of effective insecticide resistance management strategies is discussed. (C)

    The cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases are an extremely important
    metabolic system involved in the metabolism of endogenous compounds and
    xenobiotics. Collectively, P450 monooxygenases can metabolize numerous
    substrates and carry out multiple oxidative reactions. The large number: of
    substrates metabolized is due to the plethora of P450 isoforms and to the
    broad substrate specificity of some isoforms. Monooxygenases of insects have
    several functional roles, including growth, development, feeding and
    protection against xenobiotics, including resistance to pesticides and
    tolerance to plant toxins. This review begins with background information
    about P450s and their evolution, followed by a discussion of the
    extraordinary diversity of insect P450s. Given the enormous interest in
    studying individual P450s, we then provide a synopsis of the different
    methods that have been used in their isolation and the substrates that are
    known to be metabolized. We conclude by summarizing the lessons we have
    learned from the study of individual insect P450s, including their roles in
    insecticide resistance, plant-insect interactions and insect physiology.
    However, these studies are just the 'tip of the iceberg'. Our knowledge
    continues to expand at a rapid pace, suggesting that the next decade will
    outpace the last in, terms of improving our understanding of the cytochromes
    P450 of insects. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

  abstract: >-
    Epistasis is the nonadditive interaction between different loci which
    contribute to a phenotype. Epistasis between independent loci conferring
    insecticide resistance is important to investigate as this phenomenon can
    shape the rate that resistance evolves and can dictate the level of
    resistance in the field. The evolution of insecticide resistance in
    mosquitoes is a growing and world-wide problem. The two major mechanisms
    that confer resistance to permethrin in Culex mosquitoes are target site
    insensitivity (i.e. kdr) and enhanced detoxification by cytochrome P450
    monooxygenases. Using three strains of mosquitoes, and crosses between these
    strains, we assessed the relative contribution of the two independent loci
    conferring permethrin resistance, individually and when present together. We
    found that for all genotype combinations tested, Culex pipiens
    quinquefasciatus exhibited multiplicative interactions between kdr and P450
    detoxification, whether the resistance alleles were homozygous or
    heterozygous. These results provide a basis for further analysis of the
    evolution and maintenance of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.

    A cytochrome P-450 (P-450) was purified from abdominal microsomes of
    untreated and phenobarbital treated susceptible (S +) and
    insecticide-resistant (LPR) houseflies using HPLC purification procedures.
    The purified P-450s exhibited the same apparent molecular masses (54,400
    dalton) and could not be distinguished from each other on the basis of HPLC
    chromatographic properties, reduced CO-difference absorbance maxima (447 +/-
    0.5 nm), or partial NH2-terminal sequences (MLLLLLLIVVTTLYIFAKL). Since
    these P-450s were indistinguishable and were immunologically identical to
    cytochrome P-450Ipr we conclude that these P-450s are in fact cytochrome
    P-450Ipr. The level of P-450Ipr was increased twofold after PB exposure in
    the S + strain, while the level of P-450Ipr did not change in the LPR
    strain. Immunoinhibition of ECOD activity with anti-P-450Ipr antiserum
    suggests that PB treatment in S + house flies induced P-450Ipr, and other
    forms of cytochromes P-450 with high activity toward this substrate. (C)

  abstract: >-
    Insect silk glands are ectodermal organs that evolved several times in the
    phylogeny from one of the following cell types: epidermal cells associated
    with bristle formation; sex accessory glands; larval Malpighian tubules; and
    larval labial salivary glands. As far as is known, the ultrastructure of the
    silk-producing cells is similar in all gland types, except for the labial
    glands of lower Hymenoptera. In most Lepidoptera and Trichoptera, the
    posterior gland region secretes fibroin and one to several small proteins;
    this core of silk is enveloped in the middle region of the gland by a
    mixture of sericins. The cuticle-lined anterior region provides the gland
    outlet. Lepidopteran silk glands become secretory prior to hatching. During
    larval life they increase their secretory potential by growing in size and
    ploidy. Their function fluctuates in each instar according to a “larval”
    pattern, which is characterized by the initiation of intensive RNA
    transcription with the resumption of feeding, by a high rate of
    proteosynthesis during feeding, and by cessation of these activities with
    the advancement of the next molt. In the last-larval instar, the silk glands
    develop according to a metamorphic pattern that differs from the larval one
    by enhanced function and, especially, by the programming of silk glands for
    histolysis. Starvation of larvae causes silk gland regression, cold shock
    prevents spinning, and exposure of larvae to alcohol vapours kills certain
    silk gland cells. Development of silk glands is altered with hormonal
    treatments of larvae. Juvenile hormone (JH) curbs silk gland function,
    prevents their degeneration, and, indirectly, it can cause an increase in
    silk production. Low doses of ecdysteroids accelerate silk gland development
    to increased function, while high doses cause regression and degeneration.
    Juvenile hormone anologues and anti-JH compounds are used in sericulture to
    control the yield and quality of silk. Available data are consistent with
    the following scheme of the hormonal control of silk glands. The change from
    the larval to the metamorphic developmental pattern is caused by a drop in
    JH titre. Realization of the pattern depends on consecutive action of
    several factors: trace amounts of JH in the last-larval instar affect silk
    glands via regulation of feeding and molt timing; function of silk glands
    depends on nutrient supply and it is stimulated by a brain neurohormone;
    slight elevation of ecdysteroid titre, which is associated with the
    termination of feeding and initiation of cocoon spinning, may be implicated
    in the culmination of proteosynthesis, and in the initiation of functional
    regression in the silk glands; the molt-inducing surge of ecdysteroids
    induces regression in the silk glands developing according to the larval
    pattern, but degeneration in those completing the metamorphic developmental
    pattern.

    Drosophila responds to infection by producing a broad range of antimicrobial
    agents in the fat body and more restricted responses in tissues such as the
    gut, trachea, and malpighian tubules. The regulation of antimicrobial genes
    in larval fat depends on linked Rel/NF-kappa B and GATA binding sites.
    Serpent functions as the major GATA transcription factor in the larval fat
    body. However, the transcriptional regulation of other tissue-specific
    responses is less well understood. Here, we present evidence that dGATAe
    regulates antimicrobial gene expression in the midgut. Regulatory regions
    for antimicrobial genes Diptericin and Metchnikowin require GATA sites for
    activation in the midgut, where Grain (dGATAc), dGATAd, and dGATAe are
    expressed in overlapping domains. Ectopic expression of dGATAe in the larval
    fat body, where it is normally absent, causes dramatic up-regulation of
    numerous innate immunity and gut genes, as judged by microarray analysis and
    in situ hybridization. Ectopic dGATAe also causes a host of symptoms
    reminiscent of hyperactive Toll (Toll(10b)) mutants, but without apparent
    activation of Toll signaling. Based on this evidence we propose that dGATAe
    mediates a Toll-independent immune response in the midgut, providing a
    window into the first and perhaps most ancient line of animal defense.

    We report the isolation, sequence, and pattern of gene expression of members
    of the KNOTTED1 (KN1)-type class 1 homeobox gene family from rice.
    Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the rice genome revealed that all of
    the rice homeobox genes that we have isolated have one or two direct
    homologs in maize. Of the homeobox genes that we tested, all exhibited
    expression in a restricted region of the embryo that defines the position at
    which the shoot apical meristem (SAM) would eventually develop, prior to
    visible organ formation. Several distinct spatial and temporal expression
    patterns were observed for the different genes in this region. After shoot
    formation, the expression patterns of these homeobox genes were variable in
    the region of the SAM. These results suggest that the rice KN1-type class 1
    homeobox genes function cooperatively to establish the SAM before shoot
    formation and that after shoot formation, their functions differ.

  abstract: >-
    Inbreeding frequently reduces the fitness of organisms, but little is known
    about how this phenomenon can affect the biological control. Host fidelity
    provides an adaptive advantage to aphid parasitoids, allowing females to
    find their aphid host more quickly in heterogeneous environments. This trait
    is mediated by the learning of signals, mainly chemical cues emitted from
    the host in which parasitoids developed (natal). This article is aimed at
    studying whether host fidelity can be altered after many generations of
    inbreeding reproduction in caged laboratory populations, for which host
    preference and fitness parameters were measured in the parasitoid wasp
    Aphidius ervi. Also, the effect of the natal/non-natal hosts was studied,
    using parasitoids originated from the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and
    the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). We observed a loss of host fidelity in
    the studied A. ervi populations, irrespective of their natal aphid host,
    which contrasts with previous reports showing preference for natal hosts in
    outbred laboratory populations. The loss of host fidelity is discussed in
    terms of the origin of populations; the sex ratio was strongly biased toward
    males and long-time maintenance under laboratory conditions. Our results
    highlight the need for controlling the genetic diversity of caged
    parasitoids before they are released into fields, as a long period of
    inbreeding could negatively affect the biological control.

  abstract: >-
    In Drosophila, the gene pipe is expressed in follicle cells, the somatic
    cells that surround the forming egg during maturation, specifically on one
    side of the egg chamber. This asymmetry establishes the dorsoventral axis of
    the future embryo. Through the action of pipe, the ligand spatzle, that is
    located in the perivitelline fluid of the embryo, is activated ventrally.
    This signal activates Toll, a membrane-bound receptor. According to present
    knowledge, pipe encodes two different transcripts, one of which restored
    ventral pattern elements to embryos when introduced into mutant pipe
    females. Here we show that pipe is far more complex than previously
    reported. It encodes not two, but at least ten different transcripts, two of
    which are localized to ventral follicle cells, The transcripts contain one
    of ten copies of a variable domain, all homologous to heparan sulfate
    a-sulfotransferase, an enzyme known to modify heparan sulfate proteoglycans,
    which are molecules that can kind ligands. The complex gene structure of
    pipe thus evolved by duplications of one exon, a strategy used by genes of
    the immunoglobulin superfamily to generate molecular diversity. We show that
    pipe transcripts can be eliminated by RNAi, although in this method
    double-stranded RNA is injected in embryos, while pipe transcripts appear in
    the adult ovary. Our data suggest that at least two different pipe
    transcripts redundantly provide the ventralizing pipe function. 3' of pipe
    we identified an enhancer element that drives a lacZ reporter gene
    specifically in ventral follicle cells. Since pipe transcripts are found in
    salivary glands, and since expression of salivary gland genes is dependent
    on signaling molecules, we speculate that pipe became localized to ventral
    follicle cells by a preexisting control system after acquiring a follicle
    cell enhancer. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

    * Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) provides
    high-resolution population genomic data at low cost, and has become an
    important component in ecological and evolutionary studies. As with all
    high-throughput technologies, analytic strategies require critical
    validation to ensure precise and unbiased interpretation.



    * To test the impact of bioinformatic data processing on downstream
    population genetic inferences, we analysed mammalian RAD-seq data (>100
    individuals) with 312 combinations of methodology (de novo vs. mapping to
    references of increasing divergence) and filtering criteria (missing data,
    HWE, FIS, coverage, mapping and genotype quality). In an effort to identify
    commonalities and biases in all pipelines, we computed summary statistics
    (nr. loci, nr. SNP, π, Hetobs, FIS, FST, Ne and m) and compared the results
    to independent null expectations (isolation-by-distance correlation,
    expected transition-to-transversion ratio Ts/Tv and Mendelian mismatch rates
    of known parent–offspring trios).



    * We observed large differences between reference-based and de novo
    approaches, the former generally calling more SNPs and reducing FIS and
    Ts/Tv. Data completion levels showed little impact on most summary
    statistics, and FST estimates were robust across all pipelines. The site
    frequency spectrum was highly sensitive to the chosen approach as reflected
    in large variance of parameter estimates across demographic scenarios
    (single-population bottlenecks and isolation-with-migration model). Null
    expectations were best met by reference-based approaches, although
    contingent on the specific criteria.



    * We recommend that RAD-seq studies employ reference-based approaches to a
    closely related genome, and due to the high stochasticity associated with
    the pipeline advocate the use of multiple pipelines to ensure robust
    population genetic and demographic inferences.

    AbstractHistone acetylation regulates many cellular processes, and specific
    acetylation marks, either singly or in combination, produce distinct
    outcomes. For example, the acetylation pattern on newly synthesized histones
    is important for their assembly into nucleosomes by histone chaperones.
    Additionally, the degree of chromatin compaction and folding may be
    regulated by acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16. Histone acetylation
    also regulates the formation of heterochromatin; deacetylation of H4 lysine
    16 is important for spreading of heterochromatin components, whereas
    acetylation of this site serves as a barrier to this spreading. Finally,
    histone acetylation is critical for gene transcription, but recent results
    suggest that deacetylation of certain sites also plays an important role.
    There are many histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases, with
    differing preferences for the various histone proteins and for specific
    sites on individual histones. Determining how these enzymes create distinct
    acetylation patterns and regulate the functional outcome is an important
    challenge.

    The third antennal segment (funiculus) and the maxillary palp are the main
    and accessory olfactory sense organs of Drosophila melanogaster. Cryofixed
    antennae and palps revealed a superior preservation of the sensory dendrites
    and other cellular details as compared to conventional chemical fixation.
    Extensive cross-section series through funiculus and palp were studied in
    order to obtain as complete an evaluation as possible of the sensillar
    complement on these appendages. About 75% of all sensilla on the male and
    female funiculus were individually studied and their position on the
    antennal surface mapped. Dimensions of the cuticular apparatus of the
    various types of sensilla are provided as well as the number of innervating
    receptor neurons. Particular attention has been paid to the cuticular gores
    important for stimulus transport and to the sensory dendrites. On the
    funiculus surface, all sensilla have multiple wall pores: sensilla (s.)
    trichodea and s. basiconica are single-walled, a. coeloconica are
    double-walled. The distribution of s. trichodea and s. basiconica follows
    opposing gradients along a diagonal axis parallel to the axis of the arista
    from proximo-medial to disto-lateral. In this disto-lateral direction the
    density of a. trichodea increases while that of the s. basiconica decreases.
    S. trichodea occur in three subtypes with one, two or three receptor
    neurons. Basiconic sensilla can be subdivided into three subtypes of large
    s, basiconica (with two or four receptor neurons), three subtypes of thin s.
    basiconica (with mostly two, rarely four neurons), and one subtype of small
    s. basiconica with two receptor neurons. Large s. basiconica occur only in
    the most proximal region (the 'LB-zone'); thin s. basiconica are most common
    in a belt that borders the LB-zone distally, while small s. basiconica are
    most numerous even further distally along the mentioned diagonal axis in
    between the s. trichodea. S. intermedia are single-walled, multiporous
    sensilla which combine features of s. trichodea and s. basiconica; they are
    found in two subtypes with two or three receptor neurons, in the same region
    where s. trichodea abound. The s. coeloconica are irregularly distributed
    over the funicular surface, and occur in two subtypes with two or three
    receptor neurons. Sexual dimorphism on the antenna is moderate, the female
    funiculus is a bit longer and carries a larger number of small s. basiconica
    and large s. basiconica of the LB-I subtype; the male funiculus, however,
    has more s. trichodea than the female. On the maxillary palp, besides
    mechanoreceptive s, chaetica, there are only s. basiconica with two receptor
    neurons. According to the fine structure of their sensory dendrites, three
    subtypes can be discriminated which are distributed in a random pattern. The
    functional significance of the described structures and distribution awaits
    future immunocytochemical and electrophysiological experiments. (C) 2000

    Antennae and maxillary palps of Drosophila melanogaster were studied with
    the electron microscope on serial sections of cryofixed specimens. The
    number of epidermal cells roughly equals the number of sensilla, except for
    regions where the latter are scarce or absent. Each epidermal cell forms
    about two non-innervated spinules, a prominent subcuticular space and a
    conspicuous basal labyrinth, suggesting a high rate of fluid transport
    through the sensory epithelium. The internal organization and fine structure
    of trichoid, intermediate and basiconic sensilla is very similar. Receptor
    cell somata are invested by thin glial sheaths extending distad to the inner
    dendritic segments. Further distally, the the cogen cell forms a sleeve
    around the dendrites, but an extracellular dendrite sheath is absent. At the
    base of the cuticular apparatus, the inner sensillum-lymph space around the
    ciliary and outer dendritic segments is confluent with the large outer
    sensillum-lymph space formed by the trichogen and tormogen cells. All three
    auxiliary cells exhibit many features of secretory and transport cells but
    extend only thin basal processes towards the haemolymph sinus. The bauplan
    and fine structure of coeloconic sensilla differs in the following aspects:
    (1) the ciliary segment of the dendrites is located deeper below the base of
    the cuticular apparatus than in the other sensillum types; (2) a prominent
    dendrite sheath is always present, separating inner and outer
    sensillum-lymph spaces completely; (3) the apical microlamellae of the
    auxiliary cells are more elaborate, but free sensillum-lymph spaces are
    almost absent; (4) there are always four not three auxiliary cells.
    Morphometric data are presented on the diameter of inner and outer dendritic
    segments and on the size of receptor cells, as well as of the receptor and
    auxiliary cell nuclei. The special fine structural features of Drosophila
    olfactory sensilla are discussed under the aspects of sensillar function and
    the localization of proteins relevant for stimulus transduction. (C) 2001

    Carefully analyzed expression profiles can serve as a valuable reference for
    deciphering gene functions. We exploited the potential of whole genome
    microarrays to measure the spatial and temporal expression profiles of rice
    genes in 19 stages of vegetative and reproductive development. We could
    verify expression of 22,980 genes in at least one of the tissues.
    Differential expression analysis with respect to five vegetative tissues and
    preceding stages of development revealed reproductive
    stage-preferential/-specific genes. By using subtractive logic, we
    identified 354 and 456 genes expressing specifically during panicle and seed
    development, respectively. The metabolic/hormonal pathways and transcription
    factor families playing key role in reproductive development were elucidated
    after overlaying the expression data on the public databases and manually
    curated list of transcription factors, respectively. During floral meristem
    differentiation (P1) and male meiosis (P3), the genes involved in jasmonic
    acid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated. P6
    stage of panicle, containing mature gametophytes, exhibited enrichment of
    transcripts involved in homogalacturonon degradation. Genes regulating auxin
    biosynthesis were induced during early seed development. We validated the
    stage-specificity of regulatory regions of three panicle-specific genes,
    OsAGO3, OsSub42, and RTS, and an early seed-specific gene, XYH, in
    transgenic rice. The data generated here provides a snapshot of the
    underlying complexity of the gene networks regulating rice reproductive
    development.

    The microsomal flavoprotein NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) is
    believed to function as the primary, if not sole, electron donor for the
    microsomal cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system. Development of the
    mammalian embryo is dependent upon temporally and spatially regulated
    expression of signaling factors, many of which are synthesized and/or
    degraded via the cytochromes P450 and other pathways involving
    NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase as the electron donor. Expression of
    CYPOR as early as the two-cell stage of embryonic development (The Institute
    for Genomic Research Mouse Gene Index, version 5.0, www.tigr.org/tdb/mgi)
    suggests that CYPOR is essential for normal cellular functions and/or early
    embryogenesis. Targeted deletion of the translation start site and
    membrane-binding domain of CYPOR abolished microsomal CYPOR expression and
    led to production of a truncated, 66-kDa protein localized to the cytoplasm.
    Although early embryogenesis was not affected, a variety of embryonic
    defects was observable by day 10.5 of gestation, leading to lethality by day
    13.5. Furthermore, a deficiency of heterozygotes was observed in 2-week-old
    mice as well as late gestational age embryos, suggesting that loss of one
    CYPOR allele produced some embryonic lethality. CYPOR -/- embryos displayed
    a marked friability, consistent with defects in cell adhesion. Ninety
    percent of CYPOR -/- embryos isolated at days 10.5 or 11.5 of gestation
    could be classified as either Type I, characterized by grossly normal somite
    formation but having neural tube, cardiac, eye, and limb abnormalities, or
    Type II, characterized by a generalized retardation of development after
    approximately day 8.5 of gestation. No CYPOR -/- embryos were observed after
    day 13.5 of gestation. These studies demonstrate that loss of microsomal
    CYPOR does not block early embryonic development but is essential for
    progression past mid-gestation.

    Auxin response factors (ARFs) are key regulators of plant growth and
    development. Through interaction with auxin/indole acetic acid (Aux/IAA)
    proteins, they influence the expression of auxin response genes. An ARF gene
    family has been predicted in rice, but the functions of the individual
    structural domains of the OsARFs remain obscure. Bioinformatics was used to
    analyse the position of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), middle region (MR),
    and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) of OsARFs, and experimentally
    confirmed the presence of a classical monopartite nuclear localization
    signal (NLS) in the DBD. The DBD was shown to contribute to nuclear
    localization of OsARF proteins in addition to its known DNA-binding
    function. Interactions between 14 integrated OsARFs and 15 OsIAA proteins
    were tested using yeast two-hybrid assays. It was found that eight OsARF
    activators interacted with the 15 OsIAA proteins, while six OsARF repressors
    did not. The interactions between the MR+CTD or CTD of 10 OsARFs and 15
    OsIAA proteins were also tested and the results were consistent with those
    of each intact OsARF, although some slight differences in interaction
    intensity were observed by α-galactosidase quantitative assays. The
    truncated CTD of OsARF11 did not interact with any OsIAA, implying that the
    CTD is required for ARF-IAA dimerization, and that the MR influences the
    interaction intensity in yeast. A subset of the interactions in yeast were
    also observed in tobacco plants using firefly luciferase complementation
    imaging assays, indicating that these interactions are specific in plants,
    and might have a special role in the auxin signalling response. This study
    provides new insight into the structure of OsARF proteins and ARF-Aux/IAA
    interactions.

    The domestication of crops involves a complex process of selection in plant
    evolution and is associated with changes in the DNA regulating agronomically
    important traits. Here we report the cloning of a newly identified QTL, qSW5
    (QTL for seed width on chromosome 5), involved in the determination of grain
    width in rice. Through fine mapping, complementation testing and association
    analysis, we found that a deletion in qSW5 resulted in a significant
    increase in sink size owing to an increase in cell number in the outer glume
    of the rice flower; this trait might have been selected by ancient humans to
    increase yield of rice grains. In addition, we mapped two other defective
    functional nucleotide polymorphisms of rice domestication-related genes with
    genome-wide RFLP polymorphisms of various rice landraces. These analyses
    show that the qSW5 deletion had an important historical role in artificial
    selection, propagation of cultivation and natural crossings in rice
    domestication, and shed light on how the rice genome was domesticated.

    Sex determination, an integral precursor to sexual reproduction, is required
    to generate morphologically distinct sexes. The molecular components of
    sex-determination pathways regulating sexual differentiation have been
    identified and characterized in different organisms. The Drosophila
    doublesex (dsx) gene at the bottom of the sex-determination cascade is the
    best characterized candidate so far, and is conserved from worms (mab3 of
    Caenorhabditis elegans) to mammals (Dmrt-1). Studies of dsx homologues from
    insect species belonging to different orders position them at the bottom of
    their sex-determination cascade. The dsx homologues are regulated by a
    series of upstream regulators that show amazing diversity in different
    insect species. These results support the Wilkin’s hypothesis that evolution
    of the sex-determination cascade has taken place in reverse order, the
    bottom most gene being most conserved and the upstream genes having been
    recruited at different times during evolution. The pre-mRNA of dsx is
    sex-specifically spliced to encode male or female-specific transcription
    factors that play an important role in the regulation of sexually dimorphic
    characters in different insect species. The generalization that dsx is
    required for somatic sexual differentiation culminated with its functional
    analysis through transgenesis and knockdown experiments in diverse species
    of insects. This brief review will focus on the similarities and variations
    of dsx homologues that have been investigated in insects to date.

    Phylogenetic analyses and sequence surveys of developmental regulator gene
    families indicate that two large-scale gene duplications, most likely genome
    duplications, occurred in ancestors of vertebrates. Relaxed constraints
    allowed duplicated and thus redundant genes to diverge in a two stage
    mechanism. Neutral changes dominated at first but then positively selected
    regulatory changes evolved the novel and increasingly complex vertebrate
    developmental program.

    The computer software used for genomic analysis has become a crucial
    component of the infrastructure for life sciences. However, genomic software
    is still typically developed in an ad hoc manner, with inadequate funding,
    and by academic researchers not trained in software development, at
    substantial costs to the research community. I examine the roots of the
    incongruity between the importance of and the degree of investment in
    genomic software, and I suggest several potential remedies for current
    problems. As genomics continues to grow, new strategies for funding and
    developing the software that powers the field will become increasingly
    essential.

    Multiple sequence alignments are fundamental to many sequence analysis
    methods. Most alignments are computed using the progressive alignment
    heuristic. These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some
    analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands
    of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while
    sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale
    badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program
    called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein
    sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the
    package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality
    aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in
    terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful
    features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing
    alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in
    public databases like Pfam.

    BACKGROUND:Strand specific RNA sequencing is rapidly replacing conventional
    cDNA sequencing as an approach for assessing information about the
    transcriptome. Alongside improved laboratory protocols the development of
    bioinformatical tools is steadily progressing. In the current procedure the
    Illumina TruSeq library preparation kit is used, along with additional
    reagents, to make stranded libraries in an automated fashion which are then
    sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000. By the use of freely available
    bioinformatical tools we show, through quality metrics, that the protocol is
    robust and reproducible. We further highlight the practicality of strand
    specific libraries by comparing expression of strand specific libraries to
    non-stranded libraries, by looking at known antisense transcription of
    pseudogenes and by identifying novel transcription. Furthermore, two
    ribosomal depletion kits, RiboMinus and RiboZero, are compared and two
    sequence aligners, Tophat2 and STAR, are also compared. RESULTS:The,
    non-stranded, Illumina TruSeq kit can be adapted to generate strand specific
    libraries and can be used to access detailed information on the
    transcriptome. The RiboZero kit is very effective in removing ribosomal RNA
    from total RNA and the STAR aligner produces high mapping yield in a short
    time. Strand specific data gives more detailed and correct results than does
    non-stranded data as we show when estimating expression values and in
    assembling transcripts. Even well annotated genomes need improvements and
    corrections which can be achieved using strand specific data.
    CONCLUSIONS:Researchers in the field should strive to use strand specific
    data; it allows for more confidence in the data analysis and is less likely
    to lead to false conclusions. If faced with analysing non-stranded data,
    researchers should be well aware of the caveats of that approach.

    RNA sequencing has become widely used in gene expression profiling
    experiments. Prior to any RNA sequencing experiment the quality of the RNA
    must be measured to assess whether or not it can be used for further
    downstream analysis. The RNA integrity number (RIN) is a scale used to
    measure the quality of RNA that runs from 1 (completely degraded) to 10
    (intact). Ideally, samples with high RIN (> 8) are used in RNA sequencing
    experiments. RNA, however, is a fragile molecule which is susceptible to
    degradation and obtaining high quality RNA is often hard, or even impossible
    when extracting RNA from certain clinical tissues. Thus, occasionally,
    working with low quality RNA is the only option the researcher has. Here we
    investigate the effects of RIN on RNA sequencing and suggest a computational
    method to handle data from samples with low quality RNA which also enables
    reanalysis of published datasets. Using RNA from a human cell line we
    generated and sequenced samples with varying RINs and illustrate what effect
    the RIN has on the basic procedure of RNA sequencing; both quality aspects
    and differential expression. We show that the RIN has systematic effects on
    gene coverage, false positives in differential expression and the
    quantification of duplicate reads. We introduce 3' tag counting (3TC) as a
    computational approach to reliably estimate differential expression for
    samples with low RIN. We show that using the 3TC method in differential
    expression analysis significantly reduces false positives when comparing
    samples with different RIN, while retaining reasonable sensitivity.

  abstract: >-
    There is growing awareness that androgens and estrogens have general
    metabolic roles that are not directly involved in reproductive processes.
    These include actions on vascular function, lipid and carbohydrate
    metabolism, as well as bone mineralization and epiphyseal closure in both
    sexes. In postmenopausal women, as in men, estrogen is no longer solely an
    endocrine factor but instead is produced in a number of extragonadal sites
    and acts locally at these sites in a paracrine and intracrine fashion. These
    sites include breast, bone, vasculature, and brain. Within these sites,
    aromatase action can generate high levels of estradiol locally without
    significantly affecting circulating levels. Circulating C-19 steroid
    precursors are essential substrates for extragonadal estrogen synthesis. The
    levels of these androgenic precursors decline markedly with advancing age in
    women, possible from the mid-to-late reproductive years. This may be a
    fundamental reason why women are at increased risk for bone mineral loss and
    fracture, and possibly decline of cognitive function, compared with men.
    Aromatase expression in these various sites is under the control of
    tissue-specific promotors regulated by different cohorts of transcription
    factors. Thus in principle, it should be possible to develop selective
    aromatase modulators (SAMs) that block aromatase expression, for example, in
    breast, but allow unimpaired estrogen synthesis in other tissues such as
    bone.

  abstract: >-
    Sequencing technologies have placed a wide range of genomic analyses within
    the capabilities of many laboratories. However, sequencing costs often set
    limits to the amount of sequences that can be generated and, consequently,
    the biological outcomes that can be achieved from an experimental design. In
    this Review, we discuss the issue of sequencing depth in the design of
    next-generation sequencing experiments. We review current guidelines and
    precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying
    considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome
    sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome sequencing and genomic
    location analyses (for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
    sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromosome conformation capture (3C)).

  abstract: >-
    Although genetic diversity has a cardinal role in domestication, abundant
    natural allelic variations across the rice genome that cause agronomically
    important differences between diverse varieties have not been fully
    explored. Here we implement an approach integrating genome-wide association
    testing with functional analysis on grain size in a diverse rice population.
    We report that a major quantitative trait locus, GLW7, encoding the
    plant-specific transcription factor OsSPL13, positively regulates cell size
    in the grain hull, resulting in enhanced rice grain length and yield. We
    determine that a tandem-repeat sequence in the 5' UTR of OsSPL13 alters its
    expression by affecting transcription and translation and that high
    expression of OsSPL13 is associated with large grains in tropical japonica
    rice. Further analysis indicates that the large-grain allele of GLW7 in
    tropical japonica rice was introgressed from indica varieties under
    artificial selection. Our study demonstrates that new genes can be
    effectively identified on the basis of genome-wide association data.

    A new homology model of bovine cytochrome P450scc is obtained starting from
    the recently determined crystal structure of mammalian cytochrome P450 2B4.
    The new emerging structure appears compatible with recent diffraction
    patterns of bovine P450scc microcrystals as obtained at the Microfocus
    Beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation in Grenoble and here reported
    for the first time. The same atomic structure is utilized thereby to predict
    the Mutations needed for modifying redox potential. A comprehensive
    comparison is finally carried out with the previous model present in the
    RCSB Protein DataBank also in terms of the alternative mutations being
    predicted for the same functional modification. The implication of these
    studies for optimal sensor construction is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract: >-
    The insulin /insulin-like growth factor-like signaling (IIS) pathway in
    metazoans has evolutionarily conserved roles in growth control, metabolic
    homeostasis, stress responses, reproduction, and lifespan. Genetic
    manipulations that reduce IIS in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
    the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the mouse have been shown not
    only to produce substantial increases in lifespan but also to ameliorate
    several age-related diseases. In C. elegans, the multitude of phenotypes
    produced by the reduction in IIS are all suppressed in the absence of the
    worm FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16, suggesting that they are all under
    common regulation. It is not yet clear in other animal models whether the
    activity of FOXOs mediate all of the physiological effects of reduced IIS,
    especially increased lifespan. We have addressed this issue by examining the
    effects of reduced IIS in the absence of dFOXO in Drosophila, using a newly
    generated null allele of dfoxo. We found that the removal of dFOXO almost
    completely blocks IIS-dependent lifespan extension. However, unlike in C.
    elegans, removal of dFOXO does not suppress the body size, fecundity, or
    oxidative stress resistance phenotypes of IIS-compromised flies. In
    contrast, IIS-dependent xenobiotic resistance is fully dependent on dFOXO
    activity. Our results therefore suggest that there is evolutionary
    divergence in the downstream mechanisms that mediate the effects of IIS.
    They also imply that in Drosophila, additional factors act alongside dFOXO
    to produce IIS-dependent responses in body size, fecundity, and oxidative
    stress resistance and that these phenotypes are not causal in IIS-mediated
    extension of lifespan.

  abstract: >-
    Drosophila Lnk is the single ancestral orthologue of a highly conserved
    family of structurally-related intracellular adaptor proteins, the SH2B
    proteins. As adaptors, they lack catalytic activity but contain several
    protein-protein interaction domains, thus playing a critical role in signal
    transduction from receptor tyrosine kinases to form protein networks.
    Physiological studies of SH2B function in mammals have produced conflicting
    data. However, a recent study in Drosophila has shown that Lnk is an
    important regulator of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1
    signaling (IIS) pathway during growth, functioning in parallel to the
    insulin receptor substrate, Chico. As this pathway also has an evolutionary
    conserved role in the determination of organism lifespan, we investigated
    whether Lnk is required for normal lifespan in Drosophila. Phenotypic
    analysis of mutants for Lnk revealed that loss of Lnk function results in
    increased lifespan and improved survival under conditions of oxidative
    stress and starvation. Starvation resistance was found to be associated with
    increased metabolic stores of carbohydrates and lipids indicative of
    impaired metabolism. Biochemical and genetic data suggest that Lnk functions
    in both the IIS and Ras/Mitogen activated protein Kinase (MapK) signaling
    pathways. Microarray studies support this model, showing transcriptional
    feedback onto genes in both pathways as well as indicating global changes in
    both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Finally, our data also suggest that
    Lnk itself may be a direct target of the IIS responsive transcription
    factor, dFoxo, and that dFoxo may repress Lnk expression. We therefore
    describe novel functions for a member of the SH2B protein family and provide
    the first evidence for potential mechanisms of SH2B regulation. Our findings
    suggest that IIS signaling in Drosophila may require the activity of a
    second intracellular adaptor, thereby yielding fundamental new insights into
    the functioning and role of the IIS pathway in ageing and metabolism.

    <p>Addressing the complexity of organogenesis at a system-wide level
    requires a complete understanding of adult cell types, their origin and
    precursor relationships. The Drosophila ovary has been a model to study how
    coordinated stem cell units, germline and somatic follicle stem cells,
    maintain and renew an organ. However, lack of cell-type specific tools have
    limited our ability to study the origin of individual cell types and stem
    cell units. Here, we use a single cell RNA sequencing approach to uncover
    all known cell types of the developing ovary, reveal transcriptional
    signatures, and identify cell type specific markers for lineage tracing. Our
    study identifies a novel cell type corresponding to the elusive follicle
    stem cell precursors and predicts sub-types of known cell types. Altogether,
    we reveal a previously unanticipated complexity of the developing ovary, and
    provide a comprehensive resource for the systematic analysis of ovary
    morphogenesis.</p>

    In the course of analyzing whole-genome data, it is common practice to mask
    or filter out repetitive regions of a genome, such as transposable elements
    and endogenous retroviruses, in order to focus only on genes and thus
    simplify the results. This Commentary is a plea from one member of the
    Mobile DNA community to all gene-centric researchers: please do not ignore
    the repetitive fraction of the genome. Please stop narrowing your findings
    by only analyzing a minority of the genome, and instead broaden your
    analyses to include the rich biology of repetitive and mobile DNA. In this
    article, I present four arguments supporting a case for retaining repetitive
    DNA in your genome-wide analysis.

    Assessing scientists using exploitable metrics can lead to the degradation
    of research methods even without any strategic behaviour on the part of
    individuals, via 'the natural selection of bad science.' Institutional
    incentives to maximize metrics like publication quantity and impact drive
    this dynamic. Removing these incentives is necessary, but institutional
    change is slow. However, recent developments suggest possible solutions with
    more rapid onsets. These include what we call open science improvements,
    which can reduce publication bias and improve the efficacy of peer review.
    In addition, there have been increasing calls for funders to move away from
    prestige- or innovation-based approaches in favour of lotteries. We
    investigated whether such changes are likely to improve the reproducibility
    of science even in the presence of persistent incentives for publication
    quantity through computational modelling. We found that modified lotteries,
    which allocate funding randomly among proposals that pass a threshold for
    methodological rigour, effectively reduce the rate of false discoveries,
    particularly when paired with open science improvements that increase the
    publication of negative results and improve the quality of peer review. In
    the absence of funding that targets rigour, open science improvements can
    still reduce false discoveries in the published literature but are less
    likely to improve the overall culture of research practices that underlie
    those publications. © 2019 The Authors.

    Olfaction in Drosophila is mediated by a large family of membrane-bound
    odorant receptor proteins (Ors). In heterologous cells, we investigated
    whether the structural features and signalling mechanisms of ligand-binding
    Drosophila Ors are consistent with them being G protein-coupled receptors
    (GPCRs). The detailed membrane topology of Or22a was determined by inserting
    epitope tags into the termini and predicted loop regions.
    Immunocytochemistry experiments in Drosophila S2 cells imply that Or22a has
    seven transmembrane domains but that its membrane topology is opposite to
    that of GPCRs, with a cytoplasmic N-terminus and extracellular C-terminus.
    To investigate Or signalling mechanisms, we expressed Or43b in Sf9 and
    HEK293 cells, and show that inhibitors of heterotrimeric G proteins
    (GDP-beta-S), adenylate cyclase (SQ22536), guanylyl cyclase (ODQ), cyclic
    nucleotide phosphodiesterases (IBMX) and phospholipase C (U73122) have
    negligible impact on Or43b responses. Whole cell patching
    Or43b/Or83b-transfected HEK293 cells revealed the opening of plasma membrane
    cation channels on addition of ligand. The response was blocked by lanthanum
    and by 2-APB, but not by Ruthenium red or SKF96365. Based on these data, we
    conclude that Drosophila Ors comprise a novel family of seven transmembrane
    receptors that in HEK293 cells signal by opening cation channels, through a
    mechanism that is largely independent of G proteins. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

    TransRate is a tool for reference-free quality assessment of de novo
    transcriptome assemblies. Using only the sequenced reads and the assembly as
    input, we show that multiple common artifacts of de novo transcriptome
    assembly can be readily detected. These include chimeras, structural errors,
    incomplete assembly, and base errors. TransRate evaluates these errors to
    produce a diagnostic quality score for each contig, and these contig scores
    are integrated to evaluate whole assemblies. Thus, TransRate can be used for
    de novo assembly filtering and optimization as well as comparison of
    assemblies generated using different methods from the same input reads.
    Applying the method to a data set of 155 published de novo transcriptome
    assemblies, we deconstruct the contribution that assembly method, read
    length, read quantity, and read quality make to the accuracy of de novo
    transcriptome assemblies and reveal that variance in the quality of the
    input data explains 43% of the variance in the quality of published de novo
    transcriptome assemblies. Because TransRate is reference-free, it is
    suitable for assessment of assemblies of all types of RNA, including
    assemblies of long noncoding RNA, rRNA, mRNA, and mixed RNA samples.

    The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed
    microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an
    expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated
    two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The
    purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and
    Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments
    with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in
    the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and
    contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single
    channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form
    estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators
    proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for
    incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The
    posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
    in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of
    ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to
    shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate,
    resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small.
    The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds
    that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in
    particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not
    required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with
    augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends
    to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of
    moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a
    simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data
    sets.

  abstract: >-
    Epigenetic changes to DNA, potentially heritable alterations above the
    sequence level, such as DNA methylation, are thought to underlie many
    instances of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Our understanding of the links
    between epigenetic variation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity in natural
    populations is limited. If DNA methylation underlies adaptive responses to
    different nutritional environments, methylation patterns should be
    correlated with differences in performance across nutritional environments,
    and respond to changes in the environment. Additionally, genotypes that can
    cope with a broader range of nutritional environments are expected to have
    greater flexibility in methylation patterns. We tested these predictions
    using horned beetles (genus Onthophagus), which can cope with a wide range
    of variation in larval nutrition. We surveyed levels of methylation across
    several methylated loci in lab-reared beetles originating from natural
    populations using a methylation-specific amplified fragment length
    polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. For less than half the of the loci
    investigated, methylation level was correlated with performance, measured as
    adult body size attained on a given diet, in different nutritional
    environments, with an overall greater effect in males (the more
    nutritionally plastic sex) than females. Methylation levels at most sites
    were influenced more by genotype (iso-female line) than by environment (dung
    type). Only 1 site (of 12) showed a significant genotype-by-environment
    interaction. Taken together, our results provide modest support for the
    hypothesis that DNA methylation underlies nutritional plasticity, as only
    8–16% of methylated sites conformed to all of our predictions. J. Exp. Zool.

    BACKGROUND: Previous research on insecticidal formate esters in flies and
    mosquitoes has documented toxicity profiles, metabolism characteristics and
    neurological impacts. The research presented here investigated mitochondrial
    impacts of insecticidal formate esters and their hydrolyzed metabolite
    formic acid in the model dipteran insect Drosophilo metanogaster Meig. These
    studies compared two Drosophila strains: an insecticide-susceptible strain
    (Canton-S) and a strain resistant by cytochrome P450 overexpression
    (Hikone-R).RESULTS: In initial studies investigating inhibition of
    mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, two proven insecticidal materials
    (hydramethylnon and sodium cyanide) caused significant inhibition. However,
    for insecticidal formate esters and formic acid, no significant inhibition
    was identified in either fly strain. Mitochondrial impacts of formate esters
    were then investigated further by tracking toxicant-induced cytochrome c
    release from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, a biomarker of apoptosis and
    neurological dysfunction. Formic acid and three positive control treatments
    (rotenone, antimycin A and sodium cyanide) induced cytochrome c release,
    verifying that formic acid is capable of causing mitochondrial disruption.
    However, when comparing formate ester hydrolysis and cytochrome c release
    between Drosophila strains, formic acid liberation was only weakly
    correlated with cytochrome c release in the susceptible Canton-S strain
    (r(2) = 0.70). The resistant Hikone-R strain showed no correlation (r(2) <
    0.0001) between formate ester hydrolysis and cytochrome c
    release.CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide confirmation of
    mitochondrial impacts by insecticidal formate esters and suggest links
    between mitochondrial disruption, respiratory inhibition, apoptosis and
    formate-ester-induced neurotoxicity. (c) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry

    Most heat shock proteins (Hsp) function as molecular chaperones that help
    organisms to cope with stress of both an internal and external nature. Here,
    we review the recent evidence of the relationship between stress resistance
    and inducible Hsp expression, including a characterization of factors that
    induce the heat shock response and a discussion of the associated costs. We
    report on studies of stress resistance including mild stress, effects of
    high larval densities, inbreeding and age on Hsp expression, as well as on
    natural variation in the expression of Hsps. The relationship between Hsps
    and fife history traits is discussed with special emphasis on the ecological
    and evolutionary relevance of Hsps. It is known that up-regulation of the
    Hsps is a common cellular response to increased levels of non-native
    proteins that facilitates correct protein folding/refolding or degradation
    of non-functional proteins. However, we also suggest that the expression
    level of Hsp in each species and population is a balance between benefits
    and costs, i.e. a negative impact on growth, development rate and fertility
    as a result of overexpression of Hsps. To date, investigations have focused
    primarily on the Hsp70 family. There is evidence that representatives of
    this Hsp family and other molecular chaperones play significant roles in
    relation to stress resistance. Future studies including genomic and
    proteonomic analyses will increase our understanding of molecular chaperones
    in stress research.

    The availability of full genome sequences has allowed the construction of
    microarrays, with which screening of the full genome for changes in gene
    expression is possible. This method can provide a wealth of information
    about biology at the level of gene expression and is a powerful method to
    identify genes and pathways involved in various processes. In this study, we
    report a detailed analysis of the full heat stress response in Drosophila
    melanogaster females, using whole genome gene expression arrays (Affymetrix
    Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The study focuses on up- as well as
    downregulation of genes from just before and at 8 time points after an
    application of short heat hardening (36 degrees C for 1 hour). The
    expression changes were followed up to 64 hours after the heat stress, using
    4 biological replicates. This study describes in detail the dramatic change
    in gene expression over time induced by a short-term heat treatment. We
    found both known stress responding genes and new candidate genes, and
    processes to be involved in the stress response. We identified 3 main groups
    of stress responsive genes that were early-upregulated, early downregulated,
    and late-upregulated, respectively, among 1222 differentially expressed
    genes in the data set. Comparisons with stress sensitive genes identified by
    studies of responses to other types of stress allow the discussion of
    heat-specific and general stress responses in Drosophila. Several unexpected
    features were revealed by this analysis, which suggests that novel pathways
    and mechanisms are involved in the responses to heat stress and to stress in
    general. The majority of stress responsive genes identified in this and
    other studies were downregulated, and the degree of overlap among
    downregulated genes was relatively high, whereas genes responding by
    upregulation to heat and other stress factors were more specific to the
    stress applied or to the conditions of the particular study. As an expected
    exception, heat shock genes were generally found to be upregulated by stress
    in general.

    We report in this paper the characterization of Dxbp-1, the Drosophila
    homologue of the xpb-1 gene that encodes a "bZIP"-containing transcription
    factor that plays a key role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), an
    evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway activated by an overload of
    misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Dxbp-1 is ubiquitously
    transcribed, and high levels are found in embryonic salivary glands and in
    the ovarian follicle cells committed to the synthesis of the respiratory
    appendages. Loss of function of Dxbp-1 induced a recessive larval lethality,
    thus, revealing an essential requirement for this gene. The Dxbp-1
    transcript was submitted to an "unconventional" splicing that generated a
    processed Dxbp-1s transcript encoding a DXbp-1 protein isoform, as is the
    case for yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate hac1/xbp-1 transcripts
    after UPR activation. However, in the absence of exogenously induced ER
    stress, the Dxbp-1s transcript was also detectable not only throughout
    embryonic and larval development but also in adults with a high level of
    accumulation in the male sexual apparatus and, to a lesser extent, in the
    salivary glands of the third-instar larvae. Using a Dxbp-1:GFP transgene as
    an in vivo reporter for Dxbp-1 mRNA unconventional splicing, we confirmed
    that Dxbp-1 processing took place in the salivary glands of the third-instar
    larvae. The Dxbp-1 gene appears, thus, to play an essential role during the
    development of Drosophila, hypothetically by stimulating the folding
    capacities of the ER in cells committed to intense secretory activities.

    Identifying phylogenetically distinct lineages and understanding the
    evolutionary processes by which they have arisen are important goals of
    phylogeography. This information can also help define conservation units in
    endangered species. Such analyses are being transformed by the availability
    of genomic-scale data sets and novel analytical approaches for statistically
    comparing different historical scenarios as causes of phylogeographic
    patterns. Here, we use genomic-scale restriction-site-associated DNA
    sequencing (RADseq) data to test for distinct lineages in the endangered
    Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus). We then use
    coalescent-based modeling techniques to identify the evolutionary mechanisms
    responsible for the origin of the lineages in this species. We find
    equivocal evidence for distinct phylogenetic lineages within S. catenatus
    east of the Mississippi River, but strong support for a previously
    unrecognized lineage on the western edge of the range of this snake,
    represented by populations from Iowa, USA. Snakes from these populations
    show patterns of genetic admixture with a nearby non-threatened sister
    species (Sistrurus tergeminus). Tests of historical demographic models
    support the hypothesis that the genetic distinctiveness of Iowa snakes is
    due to a combination of isolation and historical introgression between S.
    catenatus and S. tergeminus. Our work provides an example of how model-based
    analysis of genomic-scale data can help identify conservation units in rare
    species.

    Several reviews devoted to various aspects of ecdysone research have been
    published during the last few years. Therefore, this article concentrates
    mainly on the considerable progress in ecdysone research observed recently,
    and will cover the results obtained during the last 2 years. The main
    emphasis is put on the molecular mode of ecdysteroid receptor-mediated
    hormone action. Two examples of interaction with other hormonal signalling
    pathways are described, namely crosstalk with juvenile hormone and insulin.
    Some selected, recently investigated examples of the multitude of hormonal
    responses are described. Finally, ecological aspects and some practical
    applications are discussed.

    A fundamental goal of genetics and functional genomics is to identify and
    mutate every gene in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. The
    Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) gene disruption project generates
    single P-element insertion strains that each mutate unique genomic open
    reading frames. Such strains strongly facilitate further genetic and
    molecular studies of the disrupted loci, but it has remained unclear if P
    elements can be used to mutate all Drosophila genes. We now report that the
    primary collection has grown to contain 1045 strains that disrupt more than
    25% of the estimated 3600 Drosophila genes that are essential for adult
    viability. Of these P insertions, 67% have been verified by genetic tests to
    cause the associated recessive mutant phenotypes, and the validity of most
    of the remaining lines is predicted on statistical grounds. Sequences
    flanking >920 insertions have been determined to exactly position them in
    the genome and to identify 376 potentially affected transcripts from
    collections of EST sequences. Strains in the BDGP collection are available
    from the Bloomington Stock Center and have already assisted the research
    community in characterizing >250 Drosophila genes. The likely identity of
    131 additional genes in the collection is reported here. Our results show
    that Drosophila genes have a wide range of sensitivity to inactivation by P
    elements, and provide a rationale for greatly expanding the BDGP primary
    collection based entirely on insertion site sequencing. We predict that this
    approach can bring >85% of all Drosophila open reading frames under
    experimental control.

    Additional vein (Adv) is a dominant mutation that affects the first wing
    vein in Drosophila. It also manifests a recessive lethal phenotype and is
    associated with a large inversion. Using a combination of genetic and
    cytogenetic techniques, we show that Adv interacts with engrailed (en),
    likely because one of the inversion breakpoints interferes with en function.
    Genetic interaction studies reveal that Adv is lethal in trans with various
    lethal alleles of en and gives an engrailed-like wing phenotype with weak
    alleles of en. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes using en cDNA
    demonstrates that one of the inversion breakpoints lies within the en coding
    region. Although the cause of the wing phenotype is not determined herein,
    it likely is caused by the other inversion breakpoint interfering with a
    different function. The characterization of this mutation could expedite
    studies to understand what molecular events result in the Adv phenotype and
    thereby provide insight into the development of the first wing vein in
    Drosophila.

    Comparative genomics of social insects has been intensely pursued in recent
    years with the goal of providing insights into the evolution of social
    behaviour and its underlying genomic and epigenomic basis. However, the
    comparative approach has been hampered by a paucity of data on some of the
    most informative social forms (e.g. incipiently and primitively social) and
    taxa (especially members of the wasp family Vespidae) for studying social
    evolution. Here, we provide a draft genome of the primitively eusocial model
    insect Polistes dominula, accompanied by analysis of caste-related
    transcriptome and methylome sequence data for adult queens and workers.
    Polistes dominula possesses a fairly typical hymenopteran genome, but shows
    very low genomewide GC content and some evidence of reduced genome size. We
    found numerous caste-related differences in gene expression, with evidence
    that both conserved and novel genes are related to caste differences. Most
    strikingly, these –omics data reveal a major reduction in one of the major
    epigenetic mechanisms that has been previously suggested to be important for
    caste differences in social insects: DNA methylation. Along with a
    conspicuous loss of a key gene associated with environmentally responsive
    DNA methylation (the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3), these wasps have
    greatly reduced genomewide methylation to almost zero. In addition to
    providing a valuable resource for comparative analysis of social insect
    evolution, our integrative –omics data for this important behavioural and
    evolutionary model system call into question the general importance of DNA
    methylation in caste differences and evolution in social insects.

  abstract: >-
    Sequencing of multiple related species followed by comparative genomics
    analysis constitutes a powerful approach for the systematic understanding of
    any genome. Here, we use the genomes of 12 Drosophila species for the de
    novo discovery of functional elements in the fly. Each type of functional
    element shows characteristic patterns of change, or 'evolutionary
    signatures', dictated by its precise selective constraints. Such signatures
    enable recognition of new protein-coding genes and exons, spurious and
    incorrect gene annotations, and numerous unusual gene structures, including
    abundant stop-codon readthrough. Similarly, we predict non-protein-coding
    RNA genes and structures, and new microRNA (miRNA) genes. We provide
    evidence of miRNA processing and functionality from both hairpin arms and
    both DNA strands. We identify several classes of pre- and
    post-transcriptional regulatory motifs, and predict individual motif
    instances with high confidence. We also study how discovery power scales
    with the divergence and number of species compared, and we provide general
    guidelines for comparative studies.

    Substantial evidence indicates that amino acid conjugates of indole-3-acetic
    acid (IAA) function in auxin homeostasis, yet the plant enzymes involved in
    their biosynthesis have not been identified. We tested whether several
    Arabidopsis thaliana enzymes that are related to the auxin-induced soybean
    (Glycine max) GH3 gene product synthesize IAA-amino acid conjugates. In
    vitro reactions with six recombinant GH3 enzymes produced IAA conjugates
    with several amino acids, based on thin layer chromatography. The identity
    of the Ala, Asp, Phe, and Trp conjugates was verified by gas
    chromatography-mass spectrometry. Insertional mutations in GH3.1, GH3.2,
    GH3.5, and GH3.17 resulted in modestly increased sensitivity to IAA in
    seedling root. Overexpression of GH3.6 in the activation-tagged mutant
    dfl1-D did not significantly alter IAA level but resulted in 3.2- and
    4.5-fold more IAA-Asp than in wild-type seedlings and mature leaves,
    respectively. In addition to IAA, dfl1-D was less sensitive to
    indole-3-butyric acid and naphthaleneacetic acid, consistent with the fact
    that GH3.6 was active on each of these auxins. By contrast, GH3.6 and the
    other five enzymes tested were inactive on halogenated auxins, and dfl1-D
    was not resistant to these. This evidence establishes that several GH3 genes
    encode IAA-amido synthetases, which help to maintain auxin homeostasis by
    conjugating excess IAA to amino acids.

    A striking feature of the antigen coding genes of the Major
    Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is their genetic diversity. However, the
    exact mechanisms maintaining this diversity remain elusive. Modelling
    indicates that Divergent..., The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is
    the most genetically diverse region of the genome in most vertebrates. Some
    form of balancing selection is necessary to account for the extreme
    diversity, but the precise mechanism of balancing selection is unknown. Due
    to the way MHC molecules determine immune recognition, overdominance (also
    referred to as heterozygote advantage) has been suggested as the main
    driving force behind this unrivalled diversity. However, both theoretical
    results and simulation models have shown that overdominance in its classical
    form cannot maintain large numbers of alleles unless all alleles confer
    unrealistically similar levels of fitness. There is increasing evidence that
    heterozygotes containing genetically divergent alleles allow for broader
    antigen presentation to immune cells, providing a selective mechanism for
    MHC polymorphism. By framing competing models of overdominance within a
    general framework, we show that a model based on Divergent Allele Advantage
    (DAA) provides a superior mechanism for maintaining alleles with a wide
    range of intrinsic merits, as intrinsically less-fit MHC alleles that are
    more divergent can survive under DAA. Specifically, our results demonstrate
    that a quantitative mechanism built from the DAA hypothesis is able to
    maintain polymorphism in the MHC. Applying such a model to both livestock
    breeding and conservation could provide a better way of identifying superior
    heterozygotes, and quantifying the advantages of genetic diversity at the
    MHC.

    Is genetic evolution predictable? Evolutionary developmental biologists have
    argued that, at least for morphological traits, the answer is a resounding
    yes. Most mutations causing morphological variation are expected to reside
    in the cis-regulatory, rather than the coding, regions of developmental
    genes. This "cis-regulatory hypothesis" has recently come under attack. In
    this review, we first describe and critique the arguments that have been
    proposed in support of the cis-regulatory hypothesis. We then test the
    empirical support for the cis-regulatory hypothesis with a comprehensive
    survey of mutations responsible for phenotypic evolution in multicellular
    organisms. Cis-regulatory mutations currently represent approximately 22% of
    331 identified genetic changes although the number of cis-regulatory changes
    published annually is rapidly increasing. Above the species level,
    cis-regulatory mutations altering morphology are more common than coding
    changes. Also, above the species level cis-regulatory mutations predominate
    for genes not involved in terminal differentiation. These patterns imply
    that the simple question "Do coding or cis-regulatory mutations cause more
    phenotypic evolution?" hides more interesting phenomena. Evolution in
    different kinds of populations and over different durations may result in
    selection of different kinds of mutations. Predicting the genetic basis of
    evolution requires a comprehensive synthesis of molecular developmental
    biology and population genetics.

  abstract: >-
    Cells commonly use multiprotein kinase cascades to signal information from
    the cell membrane to the nucleus. Several conserved signaling pathways
    related to the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway allow cells
    to respond to normal developmental signals as well as signals produced under
    stressful conditions. Genetic and molecular studies in Drosophila
    melanogaster over the last several years have related that components of
    stress signaling pathways, namely the Jun kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase
    signaling modules, are functionally conserved and participate in numerous
    processes during normal development. Specifically, the JNK pathway is
    required for morphogenetic movements in embryogenesis and generation of
    tissue polarity in the adult. The role of the p38 pathway in generation of
    axial polarity during oogenesis has been inferred from phenotypic analysis
    of mutations in the Drosophila homolog of DMKK3. In addition to their
    requirement for normal development, cell culture and genetic investigations
    point to a role for both the (JNK) and p38 pathways in regulation of the
    immune response in the fly. This review details the known components of
    stress signaling pathways in Drosophila and recent insights into how these
    pathways are used and regulated during development and homeostasis.

    Imidacloprid is a systemic nitroguanidine insecticide that belongs to the
    neonicotinoid family. As an agonist of the acetylcholine receptor, it
    attacks the insect nervous system and is extremely effective against various
    sucking and mining pests. Oral acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid
    and its main metabolites (5-hydroxyimidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid,
    desnitroimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, olefin, and urea derivative)
    were investigated in Apis mellifera. Acute intoxication by imidacloprid or
    its metabolites resulted in the rapid appearance of neurotoxicity symptoms,
    such as hyperresponsiveness, hyperactivity, and trembling and led to
    hyporesponsiveness and hypoactivity. For acute toxicity tests, bees were
    treated with doses of toxic compounds ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/bee
    (10-10,000 microg/kg). Acute toxicity (LD50) values of imidacloprid were
    about 60 ng/bee (600 microg/kg) at 48 h and about 40 ng/bee (400 microg/kg)
    at 72 and 96 h. Out of the six imidacloprid metabolites tested, only two
    (5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin) exhibited a toxicity close to that of
    imidacloprid. Olefin LD50 values were lower than those of imidacloprid. The
    5-hydroxyimidacloprid showed a lower toxicity than imidacloprid with a LD50
    four to six times higher than that of imidacloprid. Urea also appeared as a
    compound of nonnegligible toxicity by eliciting close to 40% mortality at
    1,000 ng/bee (10,000 microg/kg). However, no significant toxicity was
    observed with 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and
    desnitroimidacloprid in the range of doses tested. To test chronic toxicity,
    worker bees were fed sucrose solutions containing 0.1, 1, and 10 microg/L of
    imidacloprid and its metabolites for 10 d. Fifty percent mortality was
    reached at approximately 8 d. Hence, considering that sucrose syrup was
    consumed at the mean rate of 12 microl/d and per bee, after an 8-d period
    the cumulated doses were approximately 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/bee (0.1, 1, and
    10 microg/kg). Thus, all tested compounds were toxic at doses 30 to 3,000
    (olefin), 60 to 6,000 (imidacloprid), 200 to 20,000 (5-OH-imidacloprid), and
    >1,000 to 100,000 (remaining metabolites) times lower than those required to
    produce the same effect in acute intoxication studies. For all products
    tested, bee mortality was induced only 72 h after the onset of intoxication.

    In vivo distribution of the neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, was
    followed during 72 h in six biological compartments of Apis mellifera L:
    head, thorax, abdomen, haemolymph, midgut and rectum. Honeybees were treated
    orally with 100 microg of 14C-imidacloprid per kg of bee, a dose close to
    the median lethal dose. Elimination half-life of total radioactivity in
    honeybee was 25 h. Haemolymph was the compartment with the lowest and rectum
    that with the highest level of total radioactivity during the whole study,
    with a maximum 24h after treatment. Elimination half-life of imidacloprid in
    whole honeybee was 5 h. Imidacloprid was readily distributed and metabolised
    only by Phase I enzymes into five metabolites: 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid,
    4,5-dihydroxy-imidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and olefin and urea
    derivatives. The guanidine derivative was not detected. The urea derivative
    and 6-chloronicotinic acid were the main metabolites and appeared
    particularly in midgut and rectum. The olefin derivative and
    4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid preferentially occurred in head, thorax and
    abdomen, which are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich tissues. Moreover,
    they presented a peak value around 4 h after imidacloprid ingestion. These
    results explain the prolongation of imidacloprid action in bees, and
    particularly the differences between rapid intoxication symptoms and late
    mortality.

    OBJECTIVES:The sequencing by the PolyA selection is the most common approach
    for library preparation. With limited amount or degraded RNA, alternative
    protocols such as the NuGEN have been developed. However, it is not yet
    clear how the different library preparations affect the downstream analyses
    of the broad applications of RNA sequencing. METHODS AND MATERIALS:Eight
    human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) lines with high quality RNA were
    sequenced by Illumina's mRNA-Seq PolyA selection and NuGEN ENCORE library
    preparation. The following analyses and comparisons were conducted: 1) the
    numbers of genes captured by each protocol; 2) the impact of protocols on
    differentially expressed gene detection between biological replicates; 3)
    expressed single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection; 4) non-coding RNAs,
    particularly lincRNA detection; and 5) intragenic gene expression.
    RESULTS:Sequences from the NuGEN protocol had lower (75%) alignment rate
    than the PolyA (over 90%). The NuGEN protocol detected fewer genes (12-20%
    less) with a significant portion of reads mapped to non-coding regions. A
    large number of genes were differentially detected between the two
    protocols. About 17-20% of the differentially expressed genes between
    biological replicates were commonly detected between the two protocols.
    Significantly higher numbers of SNVs (5-6 times) were detected in the NuGEN
    samples, which were largely from intragenic and intergenic regions. The
    NuGEN captured fewer exons (25% less) and had higher base level coverage
    variance. While 6.3% of reads were mapped to intragenic regions in the PolyA
    samples, the percentages were much higher (20-25%) for the NuGEN samples.
    The NuGEN protocol did not detect more known non-coding RNAs such as
    lincRNAs, but targeted small and "novel" lincRNAs. CONCLUSION:Different
    library preparations can have significant impacts on downstream analysis and
    interpretation of RNA-seq data. The NuGEN provides an alternative for
    limited or degraded RNA but it has limitations for some RNA-seq
    applications.

    A transgenic system ("FLP-out") based on ycast FLP recombinase allowed
    induced overexpression of MnSOD enzyme in adult Drosophila melanogaster.
    With FLP-out a brief hear pulse (HP) of young, adult flies triggered the
    rearrangement and snbsequent expression of a MnSOD transgene throughout the
    adult life span. Control (no HP) and overexpressing (HP) flies had identical
    genetic backgrounds. The amount of MnSOD enzyme overexpression achieved
    varied among six independent transgenic lines, with increases up to 75%.
    Life span was increased in proportion to the increase in enzyme. Mean life
    span was increased by an average of 16%, with some lines showing 30-33%
    increases. Maximum life span was increased by an average of 15% with one
    line showing as much as 37% increase. Simultaneous overexpression of
    catalase with MnSOD had no added benefit, consistent with previous
    observations that catalase is present in excess in the adult fly with regard
    to life span. Cu/ZnSOD overexpression also increases mean and maximum life
    span. For both MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD lines, increased life span was not
    associated with decreased metabolic activity as measured by O-2 consumption.

  abstract: >-
    Gene expression is regulated through the activity of transcription factors
    (TFs) and chromatin-modifying proteins acting on specific DNA sequences,
    referred to as cis-regulatory elements. These include promoters, located at
    the transcription initiation sites of genes, and a variety of distal
    cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), the most common of which are transcriptional
    enhancers. Because regulated gene expression is fundamental to cell
    differentiation and acquisition of new cell fates, identifying,
    characterizing, and understanding the mechanisms of action of CRMs is
    critical for understanding development. CRM discovery has historically been
    challenging, as CRMs can be located far from the genes they regulate, have
    few readily identifiable sequence characteristics, and for many years were
    not amenable to high-throughput discovery methods. However, the recent
    availability of complete genome sequences and the development of
    next-generation sequencing methods have led to an explosion of both
    computational and empirical methods for CRM discovery in model and nonmodel
    organisms alike. Experimentally, CRMs can be identified through chromatin
    immunoprecipitation directed against TFs or histone post-translational
    modifications, identification of nucleosome-depleted ‘open’ chromatin
    regions, or sequencing-based high-throughput functional screening.
    Computational methods include comparative genomics, clustering of known or
    predicted TF-binding sites, and supervised machine-learning approaches
    trained on known CRMs. All of these methods have proven effective for CRM
    discovery, but each has its own considerations and limitations, and each is
    subject to a greater or lesser number of false-positive identifications.
    Experimental confirmation of predictions is essential, although shortcomings
    in current methods suggest that additional means of validation need to be
    developed. WIREs Dev Biol 2015, 4:59–84. doi: 10.1002/wdev.168 This article

  abstract: >-
    Changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlie the evolution of
    morphological novelty and developmental system drift. The fruitfly
    Drosophila melanogaster and the dengue and Zika vector mosquito Aedes
    aegypti have substantially similar nervous system morphology. Nevertheless,
    they show significant divergence in a set of genes co-expressed in the
    midline of the Drosophila central nervous system, including the master
    regulator single minded and downstream genes including short gastrulation,
    Star, and NetrinA. In contrast to Drosophila, we find that midline
    expression of these genes is either absent or severely diminished in A.
    aegypti. Instead, they are co-expressed in the lateral nervous system. This
    suggests that in A. aegypti this “midline GRN” has been redeployed to a new
    location while lost from its previous site of activity. In order to
    characterize the relevant GRNs, we employed the SCRMshaw method we
    previously developed to identify transcriptional cis-regulatory modules in
    both species. Analysis of these regulatory sequences in transgenic
    Drosophila suggests that the altered gene expression observed in A. aegypti
    is the result of trans-dependent redeployment of the GRN, potentially
    stemming from cis-mediated changes in the expression of sim and other as-yet
    unidentified regulators. Our results illustrate a novel “repeal, replace,
    and redeploy” mode of evolution in which a conserved GRN acquires a
    different function at a new site while its original function is co-opted by
    a different GRN. This represents a striking example of developmental system
    drift in which the dramatic shift in gene expression does not result in
    gross morphological changes, but in more subtle differences in development
    and function of the late embryonic nervous system.

  abstract: >-
    A cDNA encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme was isolated from a cDNA library of
    the corpora allata (CA) from reproductively active Diploptera punctata
    cockroaches. This P450 from the endocrine glands that produce the insect
    juvenile hormone (JH) is most closely related to P450 proteins of family 4
    and was named CYP4C7, The CYP4C7 gene is expressed selectively in the CA;
    its message could not be detected in the fat body, corpora cardiaca, or
    brain, but trace levels of expression were found in the midgut and caeca,
    The levels of CYP4C7 mRNA in the CA, measured by ribonuclease protection
    assays, were linked to the activity cycle of the glands. In adult females,
    CYP4C7 expression increased immediately after the peak of JH synthesis,
    reaching a maximum on day 7, just before oviposition, mRNA levels then
    declined after oviposition and during pregnancy. The CYP4C7 protein was
    produced in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal His-tagged recombinant protein.
    In a reconstituted system with insect NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase,
    cytochrome b(5), and NADPH, the purified CYP4C7 metabolized (2E,6E)-farnesol
    to a more polar product that was identified by GC-MS and by NMR as
    (10E)-12-hydroxyfarnesol. CYP4C7 converted JH III to 12-trans-hydroxy JH III
    and metabolized other JH-like sesquiterpenoids as well. This
    omega-hydroxylation of sesquiterpenoids appears to be a metabolic pathway in
    the corpora allata that may play a role in the suppression of JH
    biosynthesis at the end of the gonotrophic cycle.

  abstract: >-
    Apterous females of both strains of Acyrthosiphon pisum responded to being
    crowded by including some alate daughters in their progenies. Females of the
    pink strain produced many more alate offspring in response to this stimulus
    than did the green forms. The proportion of alatae in the progenies of
    crowded females of both strains was dependent upon both the duration of the
    treatment and the density of the aphids when crowded. Whereas two
    individuals of the pink strain when confined together for 24 hr induced a
    strong response in each other, aphids of the green strain produced few
    alatae unless confined in groups of 10. Control aphids starved for 24 hr in
    isolation gave no response. However, winged forms occasionally appeared,
    apparently randomly, in the offspring of unstarved but isolated pink
    females. Similar females of the green strain produced only apterous
    daughters. Larvae of both strains are irrevocably determined as alatae or
    apterae before their birth. No post-natal response to tactile stimulation or
    any other environmental factor could be demonstrated. Determination probably
    takes place shortly prior to birth. The maternal response of the green forms
    can be triggered by crowding adult females. This treatment, when applied to
    aphids of this strain prior to the larval-adult ecdyses, does not induce the
    production of alatae. However, fourth instar, and even third instar, apterae
    of the pink strain respond to a crowding stimulus by ultimately producing
    numerous alate daughters. The response to crowding can be ascribed to
    tactile stimulation only. Removal of antennae diminished the response to
    crowding considerably. Slow-motion film sequences have shown individuals of
    the pink strain to be particularly sensitive to encounters with other
    aphids. A 24-hr period of contact with the rough walls of a confining muslin
    bag induced in isolated pink aphids a response as intense as that of aphids
    subjected to any crowding treatment. Females of the green strain did not
    respond to this stimulus, and cine films show them to be much less sensitive
    to contact with other aphids than the pink forms.

  abstract: >-
    To elucidate the genetic mechanism that regulates meristem maintenance in
    monocots, here we have examined the function of the gene FLORAL ORGAN
    NUMBER2 (FON2) in Oryza sativa (rice). Mutations in FON2 cause enlargement
    of the floral meristem, resulting in an increase in the number of floral
    organs, although the vegetative and inflorescence meristems are largely
    normal. Molecular cloning reveals that FON2 encodes a small secreted
    protein, containing a CLE domain, that is closely related to CLAVATA3 in
    Arabidopsis thaliana. FON2 transcripts are localized at the apical region in
    all meristems in the aerial parts of rice plants, showing an expression
    pattern similar to that of Arabidopsis CLV3. Constitutive expression of FON2
    causes a reduction in the number of floral organs and flowers, suggesting
    that both the flower and inflorescence meristems are reduced in size. This
    action of FON2 requires the function of FON1, an ortholog of CLV1.
    Constitutive expression of FON2 also causes premature termination of the
    shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis, a phenotype similar to that caused by
    constitutive expression of CLV3. Together with our previous study of FON1,
    these results clearly indicate that the FON1-FON2 system in rice corresponds
    to the CLV signaling system in Arabidopsis and suggest that the negative
    regulation of stem cell identity by these systems may be principally
    conserved in a wide range of plants within the Angiosperms. In addition, we
    propose a model of the genetic regulation of meristem maintenance in rice
    that includes an alternative pathway independent of FON2-FON1.

  abstract: >-
    The regulation of floral organ number is closely associated with floral
    meristem size. Mutations in the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) cause
    enlargement of the floral meristem in Oryza sativa (rice), resulting in an
    increase in the number of all floral organs. Ectopic floral organs develop
    in the whorl of each organ and/or in the additional whorls that form. Inner
    floral organs are more severely affected than outer floral organs. Many
    carpel primordia develop indeterminately, and undifferentiated meristematic
    tissues remain in the center in almost-mature flowers. Consistent with this
    result, OSH1, a molecular marker of meristematic indeterminate cells in
    rice, continues to be expressed in this region. Although floral meristems
    are strongly affected by the fon1-2 mutation, vegetative and inflorescence
    meristems are largely normal, even in this strong allele. We isolated the
    FON1 gene by positional cloning and found that it encodes a leucine-rich
    repeat receptor-like kinase most similar to CLAVATA1 (CLV1) in Arabidopsis
    thaliana. This suggests that a pathway similar to the CLV signaling system
    that regulates meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis is conserved in the grass
    family. Unlike CLV1, which is predominantly expressed in the L3 layer of the
    shoot meristem, FON1 is expressed throughout the whole floral meristem,
    suggesting that small modifications to the CLV signaling pathway may be
    required to maintain the floral meristem in rice. In addition, FON1
    transcripts are detected in all meristems responsible for development of the
    aerial part of rice, suggesting that genes sharing functional redundancy
    with FON1 act in the vegetative and inflorescence meristems to mask the
    effects of the fon1 mutation.

  abstract: >-
    Through domestication, humans have substantially altered the morphology of
    Zea mays ssp. parviglumis (teosinte) into the currently recognizable maize.
    This system serves as a model for studying adaptation, genome evolution, and
    the genetics and evolution of complex traits. To examine how domestication
    has reshaped the transcriptome of maize seedlings, we used expression
    profiling of 18,242 genes for 38 diverse maize genotypes and 24 teosinte
    genotypes. We detected evidence for more than 600 genes having significantly
    different expression levels in maize compared with teosinte. Moreover, more
    than 1,100 genes showed significantly altered coexpression profiles,
    reflective of substantial rewiring of the transcriptome since domestication.
    The genes with altered expression show a significant enrichment for genes
    previously identified through population genetic analyses as likely targets
    of selection during maize domestication and improvement; 46 genes previously
    identified as putative targets of selection also exhibit altered expression
    levels and coexpression relationships. We also identified 45 genes with
    altered, primarily higher, expression in inbred relative to outcrossed
    teosinte. These genes are enriched for functions related to biotic stress
    and may reflect responses to the effects of inbreeding. This study not only
    documents alterations in the maize transcriptome following domestication,
    identifying several genes that may have contributed to the evolution of
    maize, but highlights the complementary information that can be gained by
    combining gene expression with population genetic analyses.

    BACKGROUND:Rice has been found in archaeological sites dating to 8000 bc,
    although the date of rice domestication is a matter of continuing debate.
    Two species of domesticated rice, Oryza sativa (Asian) and Oryza glaberrima
    (African) are grown globally. Numerous traits separate wild and domesticated
    rices including changes in: pericarp colour, dormancy, shattering, panicle
    architecture, tiller number, mating type and number and size of seeds.
    SCOPE:Genetic studies using diverse methodologies have uncovered a deep
    population structure within domesticated rice. Two main groups, the indica
    and japonica subspecies, have been identified with several subpopulations
    existing within each group. The antiquity of the divide has been estimated
    at more than 100 000 years ago. This date far precedes domestication,
    supporting independent domestications of indica and japonica from
    pre-differentiated pools of the wild ancestor. Crosses between subspecies
    display sterility and segregate for domestication traits, indicating that
    different populations are fixed for different networks of alleles
    conditioning these traits. Numerous domestication QTLs have been identified
    in crosses between the subspecies and in crosses between wild and
    domesticated accessions of rice. Many of the QTLs cluster in the same
    genomic regions, suggesting that a single gene with pleiotropic effects or
    that closely linked clusters of genes underlie these QTL. Recently, several
    domestication loci have been cloned from rice, including the gene
    controlling pericarp colour and two loci for shattering. The distribution
    and evolutionary history of these genes gives insight into the domestication
    process and the relationship between the subspecies. CONCLUSIONS:The
    evolutionary history of rice is complex, but recent work has shed light on
    the genetics of the transition from wild (O. rufipogon and O. nivara) to
    domesticated (O. sativa) rice. The types of genes involved and the
    geographic and genetic distribution of alleles will allow scientists to
    better understand our ancestors and breed better rice for our descendents.

  abstract: >-
    Domestication of wild plant species has provided us with crops that serve
    our human nutritional needs. Advanced DNA sequencing has propelled the
    unveiling of underlying genetic changes associated with domestication.
    Interestingly, many changes reside in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that
    control the expression of an unmodified coding sequence. Sequence variation
    in CREs can impact gene expression levels, but also developmental timing and
    tissue specificity of expression. When genes are involved in multiple
    pathways or active in several organs and developmental stages CRE
    modifications are favored in contrast to mutations in coding regions, due to
    the lack of detrimental pleiotropic effects. Therefore, learning from
    domestication, we propose that CREs are interesting targets for genome
    editing to create new alleles for plant breeding.

  abstract: >-
    Keap1/Nrf2 signaling defends organisms against the detrimental effects of
    oxidative stress and has been suggested to abate its consequences, including
    aging-associated diseases like neurodegeneration, chronic inflammation, and
    cancer. Nrf2 is a prominent target for drug discovery, and Nrf2-activating
    agents are in clinical trials for cancer chemoprevention. However, aberrant
    activation of Nrf2 by keap1 somatic mutations may contribute to
    carcinogenesis and promote resistance to chemotherapy. To evaluate potential
    functions of Keap1 and Nrf2 for organismal homeostasis, we characterized the
    pathway in Drosophila. We demonstrate that Keap1/Nrf2 signaling in the fruit
    fly is activated by oxidants, induces antioxidant and detoxification
    responses, and confers increased tolerance to oxidative stress. Importantly,
    keap1 loss-of-function mutations extend the lifespan of Drosophila males,
    supporting a role for Nrf2 signaling in the regulation of longevity.
    Interestingly, cancer chemopreventive drugs potently stimulate Drosophila
    Nrf2 activity, suggesting the fruit fly as an experimental system to
    identify and characterize such agents.

  abstract: >-
    Cap'n'collar (Cnc) transcription factors are conserved in metazoans and have
    important developmental and homeostatic functions. The vertebrate Nrf1,
    Nrf2, and Nrf3; the Caenorhabditis elegans SKN-1; and the Drosophila CncC
    comprise a subgroup of Cnc factors that mediate adaptive responses to
    cellular stress. The most studied stress-activated Cnc factor is Nrf2, which
    orchestrates the transcriptional response of cells to oxidative stressors
    and electrophilic xenobiotics. In rodent models, signaling by Nrf2 defends
    against oxidative stress and aging-associated disorders, such as
    neurodegeneration, respiratory diseases, and cancer. In humans,
    polymorphisms that decrease Nrf2 abundance have been associated with various
    pathologies of the skin, respiratory system, and digestive tract. In
    addition to preventing disease in rodents and humans, Cnc factors have
    life-span-extending and anti-aging functions in invertebrates. However,
    despite the pro-longevity and antioxidant roles of stress-activated Cnc
    factors, their activity paradoxically declines in aging model organisms and
    in humans suffering from progressive respiratory disease or
    neurodegeneration. We review the roles and regulation of stress-activated
    Cnc factors across species, present all reported instances in which their
    activity is paradoxically decreased in aging and disease, and discuss the
    possibility that the pharmacological restoration of Nrf2 signaling may be
    useful in the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.

  abstract: >-
    Three new glutathione transferase (GST) genes from the housefly Musca
    domestica are described. These genes, identified as MdGST-2, -3, and -4,
    were from cDNA clones obtained from a cDNA bank in phage lambda. The bank
    was prepared using poly(A)(+) RNA from a housefly that is highly resistant
    to organophosphate insecticides because of enhanced expression of multiple
    members of the glutathione transferase gene family. The DNA sequence of each
    is reported and has a complete open reading frame that specified an amino
    acid sequence similar to other dipteran glutathione transferases. Based on
    phylogenetic analysis, we can conclude that the insect glutathione
    transferase gene family falls into two groups, each of which evolves at a
    different rate, presumably due to differences in functional constraints. We
    show that MdGST-1 (and their homologues from Drosophila and Lucilia) evolve
    at a significantly slower rate than the other members of the gene family.
    Each house fly GST cDNA was inserted into a bacterial plasmid expression
    system and a glutathione transferase activity was expressed in Escherichia
    coli. The transcription pattern of each of these glutathione transferases
    was examined in a variety of different housefly strains that are known to
    differ in their resistance to organophosphate insecticides due to different
    patterns of glutathione transferase expression. We found that the level of
    transcription for two of our clones was positively correlated with the level
    of organophosphate resistance.

  abstract: >-
    One of the four glutathione-S-transferases (GST) that is overproduced in the
    insecticide-resistant Cornell-R strain of the housefly (Musca domestica)
    produces an activity that degrades the insecticide dimethyl parathion and
    conjugates glutathione to lindane. In earlier work, it was shown that the
    resistant Cornell-R carries an amplification, probably a duplication, of one
    or more of its GST loci and that this amplification is directly related to
    resistance. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with genomic
    DNA, multiple copies of the gene encoding the parathion-degrading activity
    (called MdGst-3) were subcloned from both the ancestral,
    insecticide-susceptible strain BPM and from the insecticide-resistant
    Cornell-R. In BPM, three different MdGst-3 genes were identified while in
    Cornell-R, 12 different MdGst-3 sequences were found that, though closely
    related to ancestral genes, had diverged by a few nucleotides. This
    diversity in MdGst3 genomic sequences in Cornell-R is reflected in the
    expressed sequences, as sampled through a cDNA bank. Population
    heterozygosity cannot account for these multiple GST genes. We suggest that
    selection for resistance to insecticides has resulted in not only
    amplification of the MdGst-3 genes but also in the divergence of sequence
    between the amplified copies.

    The molecular basis for the unique activities of rabbit cytochrome P450 2B5,
    compared with the highly related rabbit 2B4, was investigated using hybrid
    enzymes and site-directed mutagenesis. Alterations in androstenedione
    hydroxylase profiles observed with 2B4-2B5 hybrids expressed in COS cells
    showed that key amino acids are present in both the N-terminal ApaI fragment
    (codons 1-122) and an internal SstI fragment (codons 220-393). Based on
    these results, data obtained with other cytochromes P450 2B, and correlation
    to the six substrate recognition sites proposed by Gotoh (1992, J. Biol.
    Chem. 267, 83-90), reciprocal 2B4-2B5 mutants were constructed at positions
    114, 294, 363, and 367. Wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed in
    Escherichia coli, and the oxidation of a number of substrates was analyzed.
    All residues studied were found to be important for regio- and
    stereospecificity of androstenedione hydroxylation, Mutations at these
    positions also caused alterations in the oxidation of progesterone,
    benzyloxyresorufin, pentoxyresorufin, ethoxycoumarin, and benzphetamine,
    with the magnitude and direction of the changes dependent upon the enzyme,
    residue, and substrate. Major changes in activity were consistently observed
    upon mutation of residues 114 and 294 in both enzymes, and some of these
    alterations were interpreted with the help of a 3-D model of P450 2B4. For
    example, in the 2B4 Ile-114 –> Phe mutant, Phe prevents androstenedione from
    assuming a 16 beta-binding orientation and also hinders binding of
    benzyloxyresorufin, leading to a loss of activity. Conversely, the presence
    of Phe-114 stabilizes a 16 alpha-binding orientation of androstenedione,
    resulting in an increase in this activity. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

  abstract: >-
    The sequencing of numerous insect genomes has revealed dynamic changes in
    the number and identity of cytochrome P450 genes in different insects. In
    the evolutionary sense, the rapid birth and death of many P450 genes is
    observed, with only a small number of P450 genes showing orthology between
    insects with sequenced genomes. It is likely that these conserved P450s
    function in conserved pathways. In this study, we demonstrate the P450 gene,
    Cyp301a1, present in all insect genomes sequenced to date, affects the
    formation of the adult cuticle in Drosophila melanogaster. A Cyp301a1
    piggyBac insertion mutant and RNAi of Cyp301a1 both show a similar cuticle
    malformation phenotype, which can be reduced by 20-hydroxyecdysone,
    suggesting that Cyp301a1 is an important gene involved in the formation of
    the adult cuticle and may be involved in ecdysone regulation in this tissue.

    The conserved relationship between orthologs of many cytochrome P450 genes
    involved in ecdysone synthesis is not reflected in the evolution of the
    Drosophila Cyp307a genes. In Drosophila melanogaster Cyp307a1 (spook) and
    Cyp307a2 (spookier) both play essential roles in ecdysone synthesis and may
    possess biochemically redundant functions. Using phylogenetic analyses we
    show that the Drosophila Cyp307a genes were formed from two independent
    duplication events depicting a complicated evolutionary scenario. An initial
    duplication, from a Cyp307a2 ancestral gene produced the Cyp307a1 gene that
    has been maintained only in the Sophophoran subgenus. A second duplication
    in the Drosophila subgenus formed an additional paralog, Cyp307a3.
    Microsynteny is conserved for Cyp307a2 throughout the Drosophila species,
    but is not conserved between Cyp307a1 and Cyp307a3. These are located in
    different genomic positions in the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera,
    respectively. Cyp307a3 appears to encode a functional gene product and is
    expressed in a different spatial and temporal manner to Cyp307a1. This
    suggests some level of functional divergence between the Cyp307a paralogs in
    different Drosophila species.

  abstract: >-
    Aerial architecture in higher plants is dependent on the activity of the
    shoot apical meristem (SAM) and axillary meristems (AMs). The SAM produces a
    main shoot and leaf primordia, while AMs are generated at the axils of leaf
    primordia and give rise to branches and flowers. Therefore, the formation of
    AMs is a critical step in the construction of plant architecture. Here, we
    characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has
    altered AM formation. LAX2 regulates the branching of the aboveground parts
    of a rice plant throughout plant development, except for the primary branch
    in the panicle. The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it
    lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a
    reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage. The lax1 lax2 double mutant
    synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the
    presence of multiple pathways for branching. LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein
    that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts
    with LAX1. We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with
    LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation.

  abstract: "The African rice Oryza glaberrima was domesticated from its wild relative Oryza barthii about 3000\_years ago. During the domestication process, panicle complexity changed from a panicle with low complexity in O. barthii, to a highly branched panicle carrying more seeds in O. glaberrima. To understand the basis of this differential panicle development between the two species, we conducted morphological and molecular analyses of early panicle development."

  abstract: >-
    The form of seed plants is determined by the growth of a number of meristems
    including apical meristems, leaf meristems and cambium layers. We
    investigated five recessive mutant alleles of a gene REVOLUTA that is
    required to promote the growth of apical meristems and to limit cell
    division in leaves and stems of Arabidopsis thaliana. REVOLUTA maps to the
    bottom of the fifth chromosome. Apical meristems of both paraclades
    (axillary shoots) and flowers of revoluta mutants frequently fail to
    complete normal development and form incomplete or abortive structures. The
    primary shoot apical meristem sometimes also arrests development early.
    Leaves, stems and floral organs, in contrast, grow abnormally large. We show
    that in the leaf epidermis this extra growth is due to extra cell divisions
    in the leaf basal meristem. The extent of leaf growth is negatively
    correlated with the development of a paraclade in the leaf axil. The
    thickened stems contain extra cell layers, arranged in rings, indicating
    that they may result from a cambium-like meristem. These results suggest
    that the REVOLUTA gene has a role in regulating the relative growth of
    apical and non-apical meristems in Arabidopsis.

    Drosophila melanogaster has been a canonical model organism to study
    genetics, development, behavior, physiology, evolution, and population
    genetics for nearly a century. Despite this emphasis and the completion of
    its nuclear genome sequence, the timing of major speciation events leading
    to the origin of this fruit fly remain elusive because of the paucity of
    extensive fossil records and biogeographic data. Use of molecular clocks as
    an alternative has been fraught with non-clock-like accumulation of
    nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions. Here we present a novel methodology
    in which genomic mutation distances are used to overcome these limitations
    and to make use of all available gene sequence data for constructing a fruit
    fly molecular time scale. Our analysis of 2977 pairwise sequence comparisons
    from 176 nuclear genes reveals a long-term fruit fly mutation clock ticking
    at a rate of 11.1 mutations per kilobase pair per Myr. Genomic mutation
    clock-based timings of the landmark speciation events leading to the
    evolution of D. melanogaster show that it shared most recent common ancestry
    5.4 MYA with D. simulans, 12.6 MYA with D. erecta+D. orena, 12.8 MYA with D.
    yakuba+D. teisseri, 35.6 MYA with the takahashii subgroup, 41.3 MYA with the
    montium subgroup, 44.2 MYA with the ananassae subgroup, 54.9 MYA with the
    obscura group, 62.2 MYA with the willistoni group, and 62.9 MYA with the
    subgenus Drosophila. These and other estimates are compatible with those
    known from limited biogeographic and fossil records. The inferred temporal
    pattern of fruit fly evolution shows correspondence with the cooling
    patterns of paleoclimate changes and habitat fragmentation in the Cenozoic.

  abstract: >-
    Axillary shoot formation is a key determinant of plant architecture.
    Formation of the axillary shoot is regulated by initiation of the axillary
    meristem or outgrowth of the axillary bud. Here, we show that rice (Oryza
    sativa) TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1; also known as Os WUS), an ortholog of
    Arabidopsis thaliana WUS, is required to initiate axillary meristem
    development. We found that formation of the axillary meristem in rice
    proceeds via a transient state, which we term the premeristem, characterized
    by the expression of OSH1, a marker of indeterminate cells in the shoot
    apical meristem. In the tab1-1 (wus-1) mutant, however, formation of the
    axillary meristem is arrested at various stages of the premeristem zone, and
    OSH1 expression is highly reduced. TAB1/WUS is expressed in the premeristem
    zone, where it shows a partially overlapping pattern with OSH1. It is
    likely, therefore, that TAB1 plays an important role in maintaining the
    premeristem zone and in promoting the formation of the axillary meristem by
    promoting OSH1 expression. Temporal expression patterns of WUSCHEL-RELATED
    HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) indicate that WOX4 is likely to regulate meristem
    maintenance instead of TAB1 after establishment of the axillary meristem.
    Lastly, we show that the prophyll, the first leaf in the secondary axis, is
    formed from the premeristem zone and not from the axillary meristem.

  abstract: >-
    Plant development depends on the activity of various types of meristems that
    generate organs such as leaves and floral organs throughout the life cycle.
    Grass species produce complex inflorescences and unique flowers. The grass
    inflorescence is composed of different types of branches, including a
    specialized branch called a spikelet. The spikelet is a special unit of the
    inflorescence and forms one to several florets, depending on the species. In
    the floret, floral organs such as perianth organs, carpels and stamens are
    formed. In Arabidopsis, because the inflorescence meristem (IM) forms the
    floral meristems (FMs) directly on its flanks, the change of meristem fate
    is relatively simple. In contrast, in grasses, different types of meristem,
    such as the IM, the branch meristem (BM), the spikelet pair meristem (SPM)
    in some grasses, the spikelet meristem (SM) and the FM, are responsible for
    the elaboration of their complex inflorescences and flowers. Therefore,
    sequential changes of meristem fate are required, and a number of genes
    involved in the specification of the fate of each meristem have been
    identified. In this review, we focus on the following issues concerning the
    fate of the reproductive meristems in two grass species, maize (Zea mays)
    and rice (Oryza sativa): (i) meristem regulation during inflorescence
    development; (ii) specification and fate change of the BM and the SM; (iii)
    determinacy of the FM; and (iv) communication between the meristem and
    lateral organs.

    Neither the overall differences in ovariole number nor the
    caste-specifically modulated expression of vitellogenin can fully explain
    the striking caste differences in honey bee reproduction, in particular the
    mechanisms that block oogenesis in virgin queens and in workers kept in the
    presence of a queen. For this reason we investigated the initial stages of
    oogenesis in queens in relation to mating status and in workers exposed to
    different social conditions. A striking feature in ovarioles of both castes
    was a considerably elongated terminal filament which consisted not only of
    normal terminal filament cells but also contained apparently
    undifferentiated cells that were tentatively considered as stem cells. BrdU
    incorporation was detected in the upper germarium, as well as in the
    terminal filament. Cytoskeleton analysis by TRITC-phalloidin labeling for
    F-actin, and immunofluorescence detection for β-tubulin did not reveal
    structural differences in the early oogenesis steps between queens and
    queenless workers. In contrast, queenright workers showed signs of a
    disorganized microtubule and microfilament system that could explain the
    histological evidence for progressive cell death observed in the germaria.
    In addition to cytoplasmic tubulin we also detected marked intranuclear foci
    indicating the presence of nuclear βII-tubulin.

  abstract: >-
    The meristem initiates lateral organs in a regular manner, and proper
    communication between the meristem and the lateral organs ensures the normal
    development of plants. Here, we show that mutation of the rice (Oryza
    sativa) gene TONGARI-BOUSHI1 (TOB1) results in pleiotropic phenotypes in
    spikelets, such as the formation of a cone-shaped organ instead of the lemma
    or palea, the development of two florets in a spikelet, or premature
    termination of the floret meristem, in addition to reduced growth of the
    lemma or palea and elongation of the awn. These phenotypes seem to result
    from not only failure in growth of the lateral organs, but also defects in
    maintenance and organization of the meristem. For example, the cone-shaped
    organ develops as a ring-like primordium from an initial stage, suggesting
    that regulation of organ initiation in the meristem may be compromised. TOB1
    encodes a YABBY protein, which is closely related to FILAMENTOUS FLOWER in
    Arabidopsis thaliana, and is expressed in the lateral organ primordia
    without any patterns of polarization. No TOB1 expression is detected in the
    meristem, so TOB1 may act non-cell autonomously to maintain proper meristem
    organization and is therefore likely to play an important role in rice
    spikelet development.

    The genomic DNA for the two Drosophila genes, gstD1 and gstD21, were
    engineered for expression in Escherichia coli by polymerase chain reaction
    using a pair of specially designed primers. This newly designed expression
    system produced consistently high yields of the recombinant glutathione
    S-transferases (GSTs), which were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by
    S-hexyl-GSH affinity chromatography. Consistent with their differences in
    size, GST D1 and GST D21 displayed different mobilities on
    SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Circular dichroism spectrometry
    revealed some differences in the protein secondary structural organization
    between the two GST D isozymes. Polyclonal antibodies against GST D1 and GST
    D21 revealed that they are immunologically distinct from each other. The GST
    D1 antiserum cross-reacted weakly with GST D21, but the GST D21 antiserum
    had no detectable cross-reactivity with GST D1. The amino acid sequences of
    GST D1 and GST D21 have 70% identity. GST D1 is active toward CDNB with 17%
    of the catalytic efficiency of the human alpha GST121, whereas CDNB is a
    poor substrate for GST D21. Both GST D1 and GST D21 have similar levels of
    GSH peroxidase activity against cumene hydroperoxide. Another major
    difference in substrate specificities between GST D1 and GST D21 is in the
    activity of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)
    dehydrochlorinase, which exists only in the GST D1 isozyme. This is the
    first definitive demonstration that DDT dehydrochlorinase activity is an
    intrinsic property of a Drosophila GST. Our results suggest that GST D1 may
    play a role in DDT metabolism in Drosophila.

    Next-generation sequencing technology is a powerful tool for transcriptome
    analysis. However, under certain conditions, only a small amount of material
    is available, which requires more sensitive techniques that can preferably
    be used at the single-cell level. Here we describe a single-cell digital
    gene expression profiling assay. Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only a single
    mouse blastomere, we detected the expression of 75% (5,270) more genes than
    microarray techniques and identified 1,753 previously unknown splice
    junctions called by at least 5 reads. Moreover, 8–19% of the genes with
    multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the
    same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity
    of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells.
    Finally, for Dicer1−/− and Ago2−/− (Eif2c2−/−) oocytes, we found that 1,696
    and 1,553 genes, respectively, were abnormally upregulated compared to
    wild-type controls, with 619 genes in common.

  abstract: >-
    Fipronil
    (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile)
    is a highly active, broad spectrum insecticide from the phenyl pyrazole
    family, which targets the γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor. Although
    fipronil is presently widely used as an insecticide and acaricide, little
    information is available with respect to its metabolic fate and disposition
    in mammals. This study was designed to investigate the in vitro human
    metabolism of fipronil and to examine possible metabolic interactions that
    fipronil may have with other substrates. Fipronil was incubated with human
    liver microsomes (HLM) and several recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP)
    isoforms obtained from BD Biosciences. HPLC was used for metabolite
    identification and quantification. Fipronil sulfone was the predominant
    metabolite via CYP oxidation. The Km and Vmax values for human liver
    microsomes are 27.2μM and 0.11nmol/mg proteinmin, respectively; for rat
    liver microsomes (RLM) the Km and Vmax are 19.9μM and 0.39nmol/mg
    proteinmin, respectively. CYP3A4 is the major isoform responsible for
    fipronil oxidation in humans while CYP2C19 is considerably less active.
    Other human CYP isoforms have minimal or no activity toward fipronil.
    Co-expression of cytochrome b5 (b5) is essential for CYP3A4 to manifest high
    activity toward fipronil. Ketoconazole, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4,
    inhibits 78% of the HLM activity toward fipronil at a concentration of 2μM.
    Oxidative activity toward fipronil in 19 single-donor HLMs correlated well
    with their ability to oxidize testosterone. The interactions of fipronil and
    other CYP3A4 substrates, such as testosterone and diazepam, were also
    investigated. Fipronil metabolism was activated by testosterone in HLM but
    not in CYP3A4 Supersomes®. Testosterone 6β-hydroxylation in HLM was
    inhibited by fipronil. Fipronil inhibited diazepam demethylation but had
    little effect on diazepam hydroxylation. The results suggest that fipronil
    has the potential to interact with a wide range of xenobiotics or endogenous
    chemicals that are CYP3A4 substrates and that fipronil may be a useful
    substrate for the characterization of CYP3A4 in HLM.

    RNA sequencing approaches to transcriptome analysis require a large amount
    of input total RNA to yield sufficient mRNA using either poly-A selection or
    depletion of rRNA. This feature makes it difficult to miniaturize
    transcriptome analysis for greater efficiency. To address this challenge, we
    devised and validated a simple procedure for the preparation of
    whole-transcriptome cDNA libraries from a minute amount (500 pg) of total
    RNA. We compared a single-sample library prepared by this Ovation RNA-Seq
    system with two available methods of mRNA enrichment (TruSeq poly-A
    enrichment and RiboMinus rRNA depletion). Using the Ovation preparation
    method for a set of eight mouse tissue samples, the RNA sequencing data
    obtained from two different next-generation sequencing platforms (SOLiD and
    Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx) yielded negligible rRNA reads (<3.5%) while
    retaining transcriptome sequencing fidelity. We further validated the
    Ovation amplification technique by examining the resulting library
    complexity, reproducibility, evenness of transcript coverage, 5' and 3' bias
    and platform-specific biases. Notably, in this side-by-side comparison,
    SOLiD sequencing chemistry is biased toward higher GC content of
    transcriptome and Illumina Genome analyzer IIx is biased away from neutral
    to lower GC content of the transcriptomics regions.

    Reduced signaling of insulin-like peptides increases the life-span of
    nematodes, flies, and rodents. In the nematode and the fly, secondary
    hormones downstream of insulin-like signaling appear to regulate aging. In
    mammals, the order in which the hormones act is unresolved because insulin,
    insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, and thyroid hormones are
    interdependent. In all species examined to date, endocrine manipulations can
    slow aging without concurrent costs in reproduction, but with inevitable
    increases in stress resistance. Despite the similarities among mammals and
    invertebrates in insulin-like peptides and their signal cascade, more
    research is needed to determine whether these signals control aging in the
    same way in all the species by the same mechanism.

  abstract: "Under laboratory conditions, the effects of thiamethoxam were investigated in larvae, pupae and emerging honey bees after exposure at larval stages with different concentrations in the food (0.00001\_ng/μL, 0.001\_ng/μL and 1.44\_ng/μL). Thiamethoxam reduced the survival of larvae and pupae and consequently decreased the percentage of emerging honey bees. Thiamethoxam induced important physiological disturbances. It increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at all developmental stages and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase para (CaEp) activities at the pupal stages. For midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), no activity was detected in pupae stages, and no effect was observed in larvae and emerging bees. We assume that the effects of thiamethoxam on the survival, emergence and physiology of honey bees may affect the development of the colony. These results showed that attention should be paid to the exposure to pesticides during the developmental stages of the honey bee. This study represents the first investigation of the effects of thiamethoxam on the development of A.\_mellifera following larval exposure."

  abstract: >-
    Predicting how species will respond to selection pressures requires
    understanding the factors that constrain their evolution. We use genome
    engineering of Drosophila to investigate constraints on the repeated
    evolution of unrelated herbivorous insects to toxic cardiac glycosides,
    which primarily occurs via a small subset of possible functionally-relevant
    substitutions to Na+,K+-ATPase. Surprisingly, we find that frequently
    observed adaptive substitutions at two sites, 111 and 122, are lethal when
    homozygous and adult heterozygotes exhibit dominant neural dysfunction. We
    identify a phylogenetically correlated substitution, A119S, that partially
    ameliorates the deleterious effects of substitutions at 111 and 122. Despite
    contributing little to cardiac glycoside-insensitivity in vitro, A119S, like
    substitutions at 111 and 122, substantially increases adult survivorship
    upon cardiac glycoside exposure. Our results demonstrate the importance of
    epistasis in constraining adaptive paths. Moreover, by revealing distinct
    effects of substitutions in vitro and in vivo, our results underscore the
    importance of evaluating the fitness of adaptive substitutions and their
    interactions in whole organisms.

    To the prevailing biochemical/physiological classification of mechanisms of
    organismal resistance to toxicants, an additional molecular dimension is
    proposed, Predictions are developed regarding the relative prevalence of
    different classes of mutations and are found to compare favorably with
    reports from the literature. In particular, point mutations in target loci
    were the dominant form of resistance for both lab and field selection.
    Amplifications of target loci were less common than structural mutations,
    and more common for lab-selected than for field-selected strains.
    Amplification was the most common mechanism of up-regulation of metabolizing
    enzymes. In comparison, only one mutation involving cis-regulation and
    several involving trans-acting regulation were found. Mutations involving
    gene disruption and down-regulation were uncommon, but were found in
    appropriate cases, i.e., when toxicants stimulated rather than inhibited
    target function and when metabolizing enzymes converted toxicants into more
    toxic metabolites. Additional phenomena of likely but uncertain importance
    are genetic ”succession,” recombinational limitation, and negative
    cross-resistance. More work on these phenomena and on quantification of
    fitness costs of resistance is recommended.

    Artificial selection experiments provide insights into the evolutionary
    factors that can shape adaptive responses and have previously been utilized
    to examine the physiological adaptations that can improve survival to
    desiccation in Drosophila melanogaster. While such studies demonstrate that
    multiple resistance mechanisms may arise via different base populations and
    selection regimes, water retention emerges as a key mechanism for
    desiccation survival. Here, we present the physiological, correlated
    response and life history data for a new set of selection lines designed for
    the genetic dissection of desiccation resistance. After 26 generations of
    selection for desiccation resistance, female survival increased twofold. In
    contrast to previous studies, the altered resistance was associated
    primarily with enhanced dehydration tolerance and increased mass and less
    consistently with decreased rates of water loss. Life history tradeoffs and
    correlated selection responses were examined and overlap with previously
    published data. We crossed the resistant selected lines to
    desiccation-sensitive lines from the same control background to examine how
    each heterozygous resistant chromosome (excluding four) may improve
    desiccation resistance and observed that most of the resistance was due to
    genes on the third and first chromosomes, although interaction effects with
    the second chromosome were also detected. Results are compared to other
    selection responses and highlight the multiple evolutionary solutions that
    can arise when organisms are faced with a common selection pressure,
    although water loss rate remains a common mechanism in all studies.

    Many species of endoparasitoid wasps provide biological control services in
    agroecosystems. Although there is a great deal of information on the ecology
    and physiology of host/parasitoid interactions, relatively little is known
    about the protein composition of venom and how specific venom proteins
    influence physiological systems within host insects. This is a crucial gap
    in our knowledge because venom proteins act in modulating host physiology in
    ways that favor parasitoid development. Here, we identified 37 possible
    venom proteins from the polydnavirus-carrying endoparasitoid Cotesia
    chilonis by combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. The most
    abundant proteins were hydrolases, such as proteases, peptidases, esterases,
    glycosyl hydrolase, and endonucleases. Some components are classical
    parasitoid venom proteins with known functions, including extracellular
    superoxide dismutase 3, serine protease inhibitor and calreticulin. The
    venom contains novel proteins, not recorded from any other parasitoid
    species, including tolloid-like proteins, chitooligosaccharidolytic
    β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, FK506-binding protein 14, corticotropin-releasing
    factor-binding protein and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.
    These new data generate hypotheses and provide a platform for functional
    analysis of venom components.

    The architecture of inflorescences displays the spatiotemporal arrangement
    of flowers and determines plant reproductive success through affecting fruit
    set and plant interaction with biotic or abiotic factors. Flowering plants
    have evolved a remarkable diversity of inflorescence branching patterns,
    which is largely governed by developmental decisions in inflorescence
    meristems and their derived meristems between maintenance of indeterminacy
    and commitment to the floral fate. Recent findings suggest that regulation
    of inflorescence architecture is mediated by flowering time genes,
    Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1 (ALOG) family genes, and the interaction
    between the auxin pathway and floral meristem regulators. In this review, we
    discuss how the relevant new players and mechanisms account for the
    development of appropriate inflorescence structures in flowering plants in
    response to environmental and developmental signals.

    The exposure of insects to xenobiotics, such as insecticides, triggers a
    complex defence response necessary for survival. This response includes the
    induction of genes that encode key Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase
    detoxification enzymes. Drosophila melanogaster Malpighian (renal) tubules
    are critical organs in the detoxification and elimination of these foreign
    compounds, so the tubule response induced by dietary exposure to the
    insecticide permethrin was examined. We found that expression of the gene
    encoding Cytochrome P450-4e3 (Cyp4e3) is significantly up-regulated by
    Drosophila fed on permethrin and that manipulation of Cyp4e3 levels,
    specifically in the principal cells of the Malpighian tubules, impacts
    significantly on the survival of permethrin-fed flies. Both dietary exposure
    to permethrin and Cyp4e3 knockdown cause a significant elevation of
    oxidative stress-associated markers in the tubules, including H2O2 and lipid
    peroxidation byproduct, HNE (4-hydroxynonenal). Thus, Cyp4e3 may play an
    important role in regulating H2O2 levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
    where it resides, and its absence triggers a JAK/STAT and NF-κB-mediated
    stress response, similar to that observed in cells under ER stress. This
    work increases our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of insecticide
    detoxification and provides further evidence of the oxidative stress
    responses induced by permethrin metabolism.

    The sustainability of malaria control in Africa is threatened by the rise of
    insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the disease1.
    To gain a deeper understanding of how mosquito populations are evolving,
    here we sequenced the genomes of 765 specimens of Anopheles gambiae and
    Anopheles coluzzii sampled from 15 locations across Africa, and identified
    over 50 million single nucleotide polymorphisms within the accessible
    genome. These data revealed complex population structure and patterns of
    gene flow, with evidence of ancient expansions, recent bottlenecks, and
    local variation in effective population size. Strong signals of recent
    selection were observed in insecticide-resistance genes, with several sweeps
    spreading over large geographical distances and between species. The design
    of new tools for mosquito control using gene-drive systems will need to take
    account of high levels of genetic diversity in natural mosquito populations.

    With the availability of complete genome sequence for Drosophila
    melanogaster, one of the next strategic goals for fly researchers is a
    complete gene knockout collection. The P element transposon(1), the
    workhorse of D. melanogaster molecular genetics, has a pronounced nonrandom
    insertion spectrum(2). It has been estimated that 87% saturation of the
    13,500-gene complement of D. melanogaster(3) might require generating and
    analyzing up to 150,000 insertions(2). We describe specific improvements to
    the lepidopteran transposon piggyBac(4) and the P element that enabled us to
    tag and disrupt genes in D. melanogaster more efficiently. We generated over
    29,000 inserts resulting in 53% gene saturation and a more diverse
    collection of phenotypically stronger insertional alleles. We found that
    piggyBac has distinct global and local gene-tagging behavior from that of P
    elements. Notably, piggyBac excisions from the germ line are nearly always
    precise, piggyBac does not share chromosomal hotspots associated with P and
    piggyBac is more effective at gene disruption because it lacks the P bias
    for insertion in 5' regulatory sequences.

    BackgroundObesity is increasingly prevalent, yet the nutritional management
    remains contentious. It has been suggested that low glycaemic index or load
    diets may stimulate greater weight loss than higher glycaemic index or load
    diets or other weight reduction diets.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of low
    glycaemic index or load diets for weight loss in overweight or obese
    people.Search strategyTrials were identified through The Cochrane Library,
    MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and manual searches of bibliographies.Selection
    criteriaRandomised controlled trials comparing a low glycaemic index or load
    diet ( LGI) with a higher glycaemic index or load diet or other diet (
    Cdiet) in overweight or obese people.Data collection and analysisTwo authors
    independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data,
    including any information provided on adverse effects.Main resultsWe
    identified six eligible randomised controlled trials ( total of 202
    participants). Interventions ranged from five weeks to six months duration
    with up to six months follow-up after the intervention ceased. The decrease
    in body mass ( WMD -1.1 kg, 95% confidence interval ( CI) -2.0 to -0.2, P <
    0.05) ( n = 163), total fat mass ( WMD -1.1 kg, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.4, P <

    0.05) ( n = 48) was significantly greater in participants receiving LGI
    compared to Cdiets. The decrease in total cholesterol was significantly
    greater with LGI compared to Cdiets ( WMD -0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.43 to
    -0.02, P < 0.05), as was the change in LDL-cholesterol ( WMD -0.24 mmol/L,
    95% CI -0.44 to - 0.05, P < 0.05). No study reported adverse effects,
    mortality or quality of life data.Authors' conclusionsOverweight or obese
    people on LGI lost more weight and had more improvement in lipid profiles
    than those receiving Cdiets. Body mass, total fat mass, body mass index,
    total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol all decreased significantly more in
    the LGI group. In studies comparing ad libitum LGI diets to conventional
    restricted energy low-fat diets, participants fared as well or better on th
    LGI diet, even though they could eat as much as desired. Lowering the
    glycaemic load of the diet appears to be an effective method of promoting
    weight loss and improving lipid profiles and can be simply incorporated into
    a person's lifestyle. Further research with longer term follow-up will
    determine whether improvement continues long-term and improves quality of
    life.

  abstract: >-
    In the genomic era, one of the fundamental goals is to characterize the
    function of proteins on a large scale. We describe a method, PANTHER, for
    relating protein sequence relationships to function relationships in a
    robust and accurate way. PANTHER is composed of two main components: the
    PANTHER library (PANTHER/LIB) and the PANTHER index (PANTHER/X). PANTHER/LIB
    is a collection of "books," each representing a protein family as a multiple
    sequence alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree.
    Functional divergence within the family is represented by dividing the tree
    into subtrees based on shared function, and by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an
    abbreviated ontology for summarizing and navigating molecular functions and
    biological processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We apply
    PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we report the size and
    sequence diversity of the families and subfamilies, characterizing the
    relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence across a
    wide range of protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to
    give a high-level representation of gene function across the human and mouse
    genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank missense single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs), on a database-wide scale, according to their
    likelihood of affecting protein function.

  abstract: >-
    Genes vary greatly in their long- term phylogenetic stability and there
    exists no general explanation for these differences. The cytochrome P450 (
    CYP450) gene superfamily is well suited to investigating this problem
    because it is large and well studied, and it includes both stable and
    unstable genes. CYP450 genes encode oxidase enzymes that function in
    metabolism of endogenous small molecules and in detoxification of xenobiotic
    compounds. Both types of enzymes have been intensively studied. My analysis
    of ten nearly complete vertebrate genomes indicates that each genome
    contains 50 - 80 CYP450 genes, which are about evenly divided between
    phylogenetically stable and unstable genes. The stable genes are
    characterized by few or no gene duplications or losses in species ranging
    from bony fish to mammals, whereas unstable genes are characterized by
    frequent gene duplications and losses ( birth - death evolution) even among
    closely related species. All of the CYP450 genes that encode enzymes with
    known endogenous substrates are phylogenetically stable. In contrast, most
    of the unstable genes encode enzymes that function as xenobiotic
    detoxifiers. Nearly all unstable CYP450 genes in the mouse and human genomes
    reside in a few dense gene clusters, forming unstable gene islands that
    arose by recurrent local gene duplication. Evidence for positive selection
    in amino acid sequence is restricted to these unstable CYP450 genes, and
    sites of selection are associated with substrate- binding regions in the
    protein structure. These results can be explained by a general model in
    which phylogenetically stable genes have core functions in development and
    physiology, whereas unstable genes have accessory functions associated with
    unstable environmental interactions such as toxin and pathogen exposure.
    Unstable gene islands in vertebrates share some functional properties with
    bacterial genomic islands, though they arise by local gene duplication
    rather than horizontal gene transfer.

    We recently identified a new component of flavonoid transport pathways in
    Arabidopsis. The MATE protein FFT (Flower Flavonoid Transporter) is
    primarily found in guard cells and seedling roots, and mutation of the
    transporter results in floral and growth phenotypes. The nature of FFT's
    substrate requires further exploration but our data suggest that it is a
    kaempferol diglucoside. Here we discuss potential partner H(+)-ATPases and
    possible redundancy among the close homologues within the large Arabidopsis
    MATE family.

    Recent studies have provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms by
    which the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers the larval-to-adult
    metamorphosis of Drosophila. Ecdysone-induced transcription factors activate
    large sets of secondary-response genes and provide the competence for
    subsequent regulatory responses to the hormone. It seems likely that similar
    hormone-triggered regulatory hierarchies exist in other higher organisms and
    that Drosophila is providing our first glimpses of the complexities of these
    gene networks.

  abstract: >-
    DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are markers of regulatory DNA and have
    underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements
    including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers, and locus control
    regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified
    through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We
    identify ~2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known
    experimentally-validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of
    novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these
    elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin
    accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation, and regulatory factor
    occupancy patterns. We connect ~580,000 distal DHSs with their target
    promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs
    and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many
    regulatory regions is choreographed with dozens to hundreds of co-activated
    elements, and the trans-cellular DNaseI sensitivity pattern at a given
    region can predict cell type-specific functional behaviors. The DHS
    landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint.
    However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits
    higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an
    unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and
    patterns of human variation.

    Thousands of mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced, but there are
    comparatively few available mitochondrial transcriptomes. This might soon be
    changing. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) techniques have made it
    fast and cheap to generate massive amounts of mitochondrial transcriptomic
    data. Here, we explore the utility of RNA-Seq for assembling mitochondrial
    genomes and studying their expression patterns. Specifically, we investigate
    the mitochondrial transcriptomes from Polytomella non-photosynthetic green
    algae, which have among the smallest, most reduced mitochondrial genomes
    from the Archaeplastida as well as fragmented rRNA-coding regions,
    palindromic genes, and linear chromosomes with telomeres. Isolation of whole
    genomic RNA from the four known Polytomella species followed by Illumina
    paired-end sequencing generated enough mitochondrial-derived reads to easily
    recover almost-entire mitochondrial genome sequences. Read-mapping and
    coverage statistics also gave insights into Polytomella mitochondrial
    transcriptional architecture, revealing polycistronic transcripts and the
    expression of telomeres and palindromic genes. Ultimately, RNA-Seq is a
    promising, cost-effective technique for studying mitochondrial genetics, but
    it does have drawbacks, which are discussed. One of its greatest potentials,
    as shown here, is that it can be used to generate near-complete
    mitochondrial genome sequences, which could be particularly useful in
    situations where there is a lack of available mtDNA data.

  abstract: >-
    The cytochrome P450 gene superfamily is represented by 90 sequences in the
    Drosophila melanogaster genome. Of these 90 P450 sequences, 83 code for
    apparently functional genes whereas seven are apparent pseudogenes. More
    than half of the genes belong to only two families, CYP4 and CYP6. The CYP6
    family is insect specific whereas the CYP4 family includes sequences from
    vertebrates. There are eight genes coding for mitochondrial P450s as deduced
    from their homology to CYP12A1 from the house fly. The genetic map of the
    distribution of D. melanogaster P450 genes shows (a) the absence of P450
    genes on the chromosome 4 and Y, (b) more than half of the P450 genes are
    found on chromosome 2, and (c) the largest cluster contains nine genes.
    Sequence alignments were used to draw phylogenetic trees and to analyze the
    intron-exon organization of each functional P450 gene. Only five P450 genes
    are intronless. We found 57 unique intron positions, of which 23 were phase
    zero, 19 were phase one and 15 were phase two. There was a relatively good
    correlation between intron conservation and phylogenetic relationship
    between members of the P450 subfamilies. Although the function of many P450
    proteins from vertebrates, fungi, plants and bacteria is known, only a
    single P450 from D. melanogaster, CYP6A2, has been functionally
    characterized. Gene organization appears to be a useful tool in the study of
    the regulation, the physiological role and the function of these P450s.

  abstract: >-
    Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts
    of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop
    production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative
    ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for
    crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined,
    has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since
    1960. This relationship forecasts a 100-110% increase in global crop demand
    from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental
    impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If
    current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and
    greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue,
    \textasciitilde1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with
    CO(2)-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching \textasciitilde3 Gt
    y(-1) and N use \textasciitilde250 Mt y(-1) by then. In contrast, if 2050
    crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing
    croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding
    technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our
    analyses forecast land clearing of only \textasciitilde0.2 billion ha,
    greenhouse gas emissions of \textasciitilde1 Gt y(-1), and global N use of
    \textasciitilde225 Mt y(-1). Efficient management practices could
    substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing
    croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop
    demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.

    Hormonal signals can modulate lifespan and reproductive capacity across the
    animal kingdom. The use of model organisms such as worms, flies and mice has
    been fundamentally important for aging research in the discovery of genetic
    alterations that can extend healthy lifespan. The effects of mutations in
    the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-like signaling (IIS) pathways are
    evolutionarily conserved in that they can increase lifespan in all three
    animal models. Additionally, steroids and other lipophilic signaling
    molecules modulate lifespan in diverse organisms. Here we shall review how
    major hormonal pathways in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster interact to
    influence reproductive capacity and aging. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  abstract: >-
    To investigate whether alterations in mitochondrial metabolism affect
    longevity in Drosophila melanogaster, we studied lifespan in various single
    gene mutants, using inbred and outbred genetic backgrounds. As positive
    controls we included the two most intensively studied mutants of Indy, which
    encodes a Drosophila Krebs cycle intermediate transporter. It has been
    reported that flies heterozygous for these Indy mutations, which lie outside
    the coding region, show almost a doubling of lifespan. We report that only
    one of the two mutants lowers mRNA levels, implying that the lifespan
    extension observed is not attributable to the Indy mutations themselves.
    Moreover, neither Indy mutation extended lifespan in female flies in any
    genetic background tested. In the original genetic background, only the Indy
    mutation associated with altered RNA expression extended lifespan in male
    flies. However, this effect was abolished by backcrossing into standard
    outbred genetic backgrounds, and was associated with an unidentified locus
    on the X chromosome. The original Indy line with long-lived males is
    infected by the cytoplasmic symbiont Wolbachia, and the longevity of Indy
    males disappeared after tetracycline clearance of this endosymbiont. These
    findings underscore the critical importance of standardisation of genetic
    background and of cytoplasm in genetic studies of lifespan, and show that
    the lifespan extension previously claimed for Indy mutants was entirely
    attributable to confounding variation from these two sources. In addition,
    we saw no effects on lifespan of expression knockdown of the Indy
    orthologues nac-2 and nac-3 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

    Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a major crop plant and a model system for
    fruit development. Solanum is one of the largest angiosperm genera and
    includes annual and perennial plants from diverse habitats. Here we present
    a high-quality genome sequence of domesticated tomato, a draft sequence of
    its closest wild relative, Solanum pimpinellifolium, and compare them to
    each other and to the potato genome (Solanum tuberosum). The two tomato
    genomes show only 0.6% nucleotide divergence and signs of recent admixture,
    but show more than 8% divergence from potato, with nine large and several
    smaller inversions. In contrast to Arabidopsis, but similar to soybean,
    tomato and potato small RNAs map predominantly to gene-rich chromosomal
    regions, including gene promoters. The Solanum lineage has experienced two
    consecutive genome triplications: one that is ancient and shared with
    rosids, and a more recent one. These triplications set the stage for the
    neofunctionalization of genes controlling fruit characteristics, such as
    colour and fleshiness.

    Differential analysis of gene and transcript expression using
    high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is complicated by several sources
    of measurement variability and poses numerous statistical challenges. We
    present Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm that estimates expression at
    transcript-level resolution and controls for variability evident across
    replicate libraries. Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed
    transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and
    promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach
    through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the
    developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung
    fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in
    significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts,
    along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle.
    Cuffdiff 2 performs robust differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at
    transcript resolution, revealing a layer of regulation not readily
    observable with other high-throughput technologies.

    MOTIVATION:A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known
    as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run.
    These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene
    expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current
    software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice
    junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient
    read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to
    a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. RESULTS:We mapped
    the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered
    more than 72% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based
    software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported
    junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping
    nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an
    entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer.
    We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery
    from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.
    AVAILABILITY:TopHat is free, open-source software available from
    http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Supplementary data are
    available at Bioinformatics online.

    High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript
    discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms
    that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for
    alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in
    an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we
    sequenced and analyzed >430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse
    myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692
    known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62% of which are
    supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other
    species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the
    dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed
    more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that
    Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and
    complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it
    can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.

    There is currently considerable discussion about the merits of particular
    forms of agriculture. The discussion has been generated by excess food
    production in the EC, continuing public disquiet over the use of chemicals
    in food production and political agitation. Much of the debate concerns the
    merits or otherwise of organic agriculture which is often seen by the public
    as producing food free of chemicals and being more environmentally friendly.
    This article examines these notions critically dealing with each of the
    individual claims frequently made for organic agriculture. The article
    concludes that in the UK, at least, when problems with agriculture emerge
    they usually hinge around poor management not mode of agriculture. In
    environmental terms no-till farming currently seems to be better than
    others. The benefits of holistic thinking by farmers are indicated. (C) 2004

    The incorporation of science and technology into agriculture has led to
    enormous growth in crop yields, providing food security in many countries.
    From the 1950s onwards there has been increasing interference in
    agricultural policy by a few scientists who are marginal to agriculture and
    from a variety of unqualified groups. These groups and individuals have used
    fear and anxiety and have greatly exaggerated minor problems to persuade an
    unqualified public of supposed dangers in food and to try and change
    agricultural policy. Fear and emotion do not lead to good policy, and the
    cult of the amateur that has developed could have serious repercussions on
    vital food security and future agriculture in developing countries; it must
    be soundly rejected.

    Two-component signaling elements play important roles in plants, including a
    central role in cytokinin signaling. We characterized two-component elements
    from the monocot rice (Oryza sativa) using several complementary approaches.
    Phylogenetic analysis reveals relatively simple orthologous relationships
    among the histidine kinases in rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
    In contrast, the histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (OsHPs) and
    response regulators (OsRRs) display a higher degree of lineage-specific
    expansion. The intracellular localizations of several OsHPs and OsRRs were
    examined in rice and generally found to correspond to the localizations of
    their dicot counterparts. The functionality of rice type-B OsRRs was tested
    in Arabidopsis; one from a clade composed of both monocot and dicot type-B
    OsRRs complemented an Arabidopsis type-B response regulator mutant, but a
    type-B OsRR from a monocot-specific subfamily generally did not. The
    expression of genes encoding two-component elements and proteins involved in
    cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation was analyzed in rice roots and shoots
    and in response to phytohormones. Nearly all type-A OsRRs and OsHK4 were
    up-regulated in response to cytokinin, but other cytokinin signaling
    elements were not appreciably affected. Furthermore, multiple cytokinin
    oxidase (OsCKX) genes were up-regulated by cytokinin. Abscisic acid
    treatment decreased the expression of several genes involved in cytokinin
    biosynthesis and degradation. Auxin affected the expression of a few genes;
    brassinosteroid and gibberellin had only modest effects. Our results support
    a shared role for two-component elements in mediating cytokinin signaling in
    monocots and dicots and reveal how phytohormones can impact cytokinin
    function through modulating gene expression.

    Particulate matter (PM) exposure during in utero life may entail adverse
    health outcomes in later-life. Air pollution's adverse effects are known to
    alter gene expression profiles, which can be regulated by microRNAs
    (miRNAs). We investigate the potential influence of air pollution exposure
    in prenatal life on placental miRNA expression. Within the framework of the
    ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, we measured the expression of six candidate miRNAs
    in placental tissue from 210 mother-newborn pairs by qRT-PCR.
    Trimester-specific PM2.5 exposure levels were estimated for each mother's
    home address using a spatiotemporal model. Multiple regression models were
    used to study miRNA expression and in utero exposure to PM2.5 over various
    time windows during pregnancy. The placental expression of miR-21 (−33.7%,
    95% CI: −53.2 to −6.2, P = 0.022), miR-146a (−30.9%, 95% CI: −48.0 to −8.1,
    P = 0.012) and miR-222 (−25.4%, 95% CI: −43.0 to −2.4, P = 0.034) was
    inversely associated with PM2.5 exposure during the 2nd trimester of
    pregnancy, while placental expression of miR-20a and miR-21 was positively
    associated with 1st trimester exposure. Tumor suppressor phosphatase and
    tensin homolog (PTEN) was identified as a common target of the miRNAs
    significantly associated with PM exposure. Placental PTEN expression was
    strongly and positively associated (+59.6% per 5 µg/m³ increment, 95% CI:
    26.9 to 100.7, P < 0.0001) with 3rd trimester PM2.5 exposure. Further
    research is required to establish the role these early miRNA and mRNA
    expression changes might play in PM-induced health effects. We provide
    molecular evidence showing that in utero PM2.5 exposure affects miRNAs
    expression as well as its downstream target PTEN.

    In flowering plants, knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors
    play crucial roles in establishment and maintenance of the shoot apical
    meristem (SAM), from which aerial organs such as leaves, stems, and flowers
    initiate. We report that a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene Oryza sativa
    homeobox1 (OSH1) represses the brassinosteroid (BR) phytohormone pathway
    through activation of BR catabolism genes. Inducible overexpression of OSH1
    caused BR insensitivity, whereas loss of function showed a BR-overproduction
    phenotype. Genome-wide identification of loci bound and regulated by OSH1
    revealed hormonal and transcriptional regulation as the major function of
    OSH1. Among these targets, BR catabolism genes CYP734A2, CYP734A4, and
    CYP734A6 were rapidly upregulated by OSH1 induction. Furthermore, RNA
    interference knockdown plants of CYP734A genes arrested growth of the SAM
    and mimicked some osh1 phenotypes. Thus, we suggest that local control of BR
    levels by KNOX genes is a key regulatory step in SAM function.

    Self-maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), from which aerial
    organs are formed throughout the life cycle, is crucial in plant
    development. Class I Knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes restrict cell
    differentiation and play an indispensable role in maintaining the SAM.
    However, the mechanism that positively regulates their expression is
    unknown. Here, we show that expression of a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene,
    Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1), is positively regulated by direct
    autoregulation. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutants of OSH1 lose the SAM
    just after germination but can be rescued to grow until reproductive
    development when they are regenerated from callus. Double mutants of osh1
    and d6, a loss-of-function mutant of OSH15, fail to establish the SAM both
    in embryogenesis and regeneration. Expression analyses in these mutants
    reveal that KNOX gene expression is positively regulated by the phytohormone
    cytokinin and by KNOX genes themselves. We demonstrate that OSH1 directly
    binds to five KNOX loci, including OSH1 and OSH15, through evolutionarily
    conserved cis-elements and that the positive autoregulation of OSH1 is
    indispensable for its own expression and SAM maintenance. Thus, the
    maintenance of the indeterminate state mediated by positive autoregulation
    of a KNOX gene is an indispensable mechanism of self-maintenance of the SAM.

    Drosophila imaginal discs are an excellent model system for studies of
    developmental plasticity. In imaginal discs, most cells adhere strictly to
    their specific identity, but some cells undergo transdetermination, a
    process wherein the determined identity switches to another disc-specific
    identity. In this study, we performed gain-of-function screening and
    identified a gene, CG17836/Xrp1, that induces ectopic antennae in the eye
    field upon overexpression at the early eye disc stage. An essential factor
    in the distalization process, Distalles, and its upstream regulators
    Wingless, Hedgehog, and Decapentaplegic, are ectopically induced by
    CG17836/Xrp1 overexpression in eye discs, and this provides molecular
    evidence of the formation of ectopic antennae. Further, forced expression of
    CG17836/Xrp1 induced severe cell-proliferation defects. These findings
    suggest that CG17836/Xrp1 is involved in the regulation of cell
    proliferation in eye discs and affects disc identity specification.

    Experiments linking neonicotinoids and declining bee health have been
    criticized for not simulating realistic exposure. Here we quantified the
    duration and magnitude of neonicotinoid exposure in Canada’s corn-growing
    regions and used these data to design realistic experiments to investigate
    the effect of such insecticides on honey bees. Colonies near corn were
    naturally exposed to neonicotinoids for up to 4 months—the majority of the
    honey bee’s active season. Realistic experiments showed that neonicotinoids
    increased worker mortality and were associated with declines in social
    immunity and increased queenlessness over time. We also discovered that the
    acute toxicity of neonicotinoids to honey bees doubles in the presence of a
    commonly encountered fungicide. Our work demonstrates that field-realistic
    exposure to neonicotinoids can reduce honey bee health in corn-growing
    regions.

    Bee health is affected by neonicotinoids under field-realistic conditions
    across crops conditions.

    Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) is central to growth and metabolism and
    has a conserved role in aging. In C. elegans, reductions in IIS increase
    stress resistance and longevity, effects that require the IIS-inhibited FOXO
    protein DAF-16. The C. elegans transcription factor SKN-1 also defends
    against oxidative stress by mobilizing the conserved phase 2 detoxification
    response. Here we show that IIS not only opposes DAF-16 but also directly
    inhibits SKN-1 in parallel. The IIS kinases AKT-1, -2, and SGK-1
    phosphorylate SKN-1, and reduced IIS leads to constitutive SKN-1 nuclear
    accumulation in the intestine and SKN-1 target gene activation. SKN-1
    contributes to the increased stress tolerance and longevity resulting from
    reduced IIS and delays aging when expressed transgenically. Furthermore,
    SKN-1 that is constitutively active increases life span independently of
    DAF-16. Our findings indicate that the transcription network regulated by
    SKN-1 promotes longevity and is an important direct target of IIS.

    The production of antimicrobial peptides is an important aspect of host
    defense in multicellular organisms. In Drosophila, seven antimicrobial
    peptides with different spectra of activities are synthesized by the fat
    body during the immune response and secreted into the hemolymph. Using GFP
    reporter transgenes, we show here that all seven Drosophila antimicrobial
    peptides can be induced in surface epithelia in a tissue-specific manner.
    The imd gene plays a critical role in the activation of this local response
    to infection. In particular, drosomycin expression, which is regulated by
    the Toll pathway during the systemic response, is regulated by imd in the
    respiratory tract, thus demonstrating the existence of distinct regulatory
    mechanisms for local and systemic induction of antimicrobial peptide genes
    in Drosophila.

  abstract: >-
    The insect neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) triggers the
    biosynthesis and release of the molting hormone ecdysone in the prothoracic
    gland (PG), thereby controlling the timing of molting and metamorphosis.
    Despite the well-documented physiological role of PTTH and its signaling
    pathway in the PG, it is not clear whether PTTH is an essential hormone for
    ecdysone biosynthesis and development. To address this question, we
    established and characterized a PTTH knockout line in the silkworm, Bombyx
    mori. We found that PTTH knockouts showed a severe developmental delay in
    both the larval and pupal stages. Larval phenotypes of PTTH knockouts can be
    classified into three major classes: (i) developmental arrest during the
    second larval instar, (ii) precocious metamorphosis after the fourth larval
    instar (one instar earlier in comparison to the control strain), and (iii)
    metamorphosis to normal-sized pupae after completing the five larval instar
    stages. In PTTH knockout larvae, peak levels of ecdysone titers in the
    hemolymph were dramatically reduced and the timing of peaks was delayed,
    suggesting that protracted larval development is a result of the reduced and
    delayed synthesis of ecdysone in the PG. Despite these defects, low basal
    levels of ecdysone were maintained in PTTH knockout larvae, suggesting that
    the primary role of PTTH is to upregulate ecdysone biosynthesis in the PG
    during molting stages, and low basal levels of ecdysone can be maintained in
    the absence of PTTH. We also found that mRNA levels of genes involved in
    ecdysone biosynthesis and ecdysteroid signaling pathways were significantly
    reduced in PTTH knockouts. Our results provide genetic evidence that PTTH is
    not essential for development, but is required to coordinate growth and
    developmental timing.

  abstract: >-
    Understanding the general trends in developmental changes during animal
    evolution, which are often associated with morphological diversification,
    has long been a central issue in evolutionary developmental biology. Recent
    comparative transcriptomic studies revealed that gene expression profiles of
    mid-embryonic period tend to be more evolutionarily conserved than those in
    earlier or later periods. While the hourglass-like divergence of
    developmental processes has been demonstrated in a variety of animal groups
    such as vertebrates, arthropods, and nematodes, the exact mechanism leading
    to this mid-embryonic conservation remains to be clarified. One possibility
    is that the mid-embryonic period (pharyngula period in vertebrates) is
    highly prone to embryonic lethality, and the resulting negative selections
    lead to evolutionary conservation of this phase. Here, we tested this
    “mid-embryonic lethality hypothesis” by measuring the rate of lethal
    phenotypes of three different species of vertebrate embryos subjected to two
    kinds of perturbations: transient perturbations and genetic mutations.

    Circadian rhythms govern the behavior, physiology, and metabolism of living
    organisms. Recent studies have revealed the role of several genes in the
    clock mechanism both in Drosophila and in mammals. To study how gene
    expression is globally regulated by the clock mechanism, we used a high
    density oligonuelcotide probe array (GeneChip) to profile gene expression
    patterns in Drosophila under light-dark and constant dark conditions. We
    found 712 genes showing a daily fluctuation in mRNA levels under light-dark
    conditions, and among these the expression of 115 genes was still cycling in
    constant darkness, i.e. under free-running conditions. Unexpectedly the
    expression of a large number of genes cycled exclusively under constant
    darkness. We found that cycling in most of these genes was lost in the
    arrhythmic Clock (Clk) mutant under light-dark conditions. Expression of
    periodically regulated genes is coordinated locally on chromosomes where
    small clusters of genes are regulated jointly. Our findings reveal that many
    genes involved in diverse functions are under circadian control and reveal
    the complexity of circadian gene expression in Drosophila.

    The light environment is a key factor that governs a multitude of
    developmental processes during the entire life cycle of plants. An important
    and increasing part of the incident sunlight encompasses a segment of the
    UV-B region (280-320 nm) that is not entirely absorbed by the ozone layer in
    the stratosphere of the earth. This portion of the solar radiation, which
    inevitably reaches the sessile plants, can act both as an environmental
    stress factor and an informational signal. To identify Arabidopsis genes
    involved in the UV response, we monitored the gene expression profile of
    UV-B-irradiated seedlings by using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays
    comprising almost the full Arabidopsis genome (>24,000 genes). A robust set
    of early low-level UV-B-responsive genes, 100 activated and 7 repressed, was
    identified. In all cases analyzed, UV-B induction was found to be
    independent of known photoreceptors. This group of genes is suggested to
    represent the molecular readout of the signaling cascade triggered by the
    elusive UV-B photoreceptor(s). Moreover, our analysis identified
    interactions between cellular responses to different UV-B ranges that led us
    to postulate the presence of partially distinct but interacting UV-B
    perception and signaling mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that the bZIP
    transcription factor HY5 is required for UV-B-mediated regulation of a
    subset of genes.

    The ultraviolet-B (UV-B) portion of the solar radiation functions as an
    environmental signal for which plants have evolved specific and sensitive
    UV-B perception systems. The UV-B-specific UV RESPONSE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) and
    the multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1
    (COP1) are key regulators of the UV-B response. We show here that uvr8-null
    mutants are deficient in UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and hypersensitive
    to UV-B stress, whereas overexpression of UVR8 results in enhanced UV-B
    photomorphogenesis, acclimation and tolerance to UV-B stress. By using sun
    simulators, we provide evidence at the physiological level that UV-B
    acclimation mediated by the UV-B-specific photoregulatory pathway is indeed
    required for survival in sunlight. At the molecular level, we demonstrate
    that the wild type but not the mutant UVR8 and COP1 proteins directly
    interact in a UV-B-dependent, rapid manner in planta. These data
    collectively suggest that UV-B-specific interaction of COP1 and UVR8 in the
    nucleus is a very early step in signalling and responsible for the plant's
    coordinated response to UV-B ensuring UV-B acclimation and protection in the
    natural environment.

    Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation present in sunlight is an important trigger
    of photomorphogenic acclimation and stress responses in sessile land plants.
    Although numerous moss species grow in unshaded habitats, our understanding
    of their UV-B responses is very limited. The genome of the model moss
    Physcomitrella patens, which grows in sun-exposed open areas, encodes
    signaling and metabolic components that are implicated in the UV-B response
    in flowering plants. In this study, we describe the response of P. patens to
    UV-B radiation at the morphological and molecular levels. We find that P.
    patens is more capable of surviving UV-B stress than Arabidopsis
    (Arabidopsis thaliana) and describe the differential expression of
    approximately 400 moss genes in response to UV-B radiation. A comparative
    analysis of the UV-B response in P. patens and Arabidopsis reveals both
    distinct and conserved pathways.

    To optimize their growth and survival, plants perceive and respond to
    ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. However, neither the molecular identity of
    the UV-B photoreceptor nor the photoperception mechanism is known. Here we
    show that dimers of the UVR8 protein perceive UV-B, probably by a
    tryptophan-based mechanism. Absorption of UV-B induces instant
    monomerization of the photoreceptor and interaction with COP1, the central
    regulator of light signaling. Thereby this signaling cascade controlled by
    UVR8 mediates UV-B photomorphogenic responses securing plant acclimation and
    thus promotes survival in sunlight.

    In contrast to phytochrome-, cryptochrome- and phototropin-sensing systems,
    about which considerable knowledge has accumulated, the ultraviolet-B (UVB)
    photoreceptor is not yet known at the molecular level. Information about the
    downstream signalling events that underlie UVB-provoked physiological
    responses is limited. Recent whole-genome transcript profiling, isolation of
    mutants that are impaired in specific UVB-induced responses and detailed
    photobiological studies suggest that responses that are triggered by shorter
    wavelength UVB and longer wavelength UVB are mediated by two different
    sensory systems. The bZIP transcription factor HY5 was recently identified
    as an important player in the long-wavelength UVB-induced signal
    transduction cascade. Advances in the development of luciferase-reporter
    lines will make it feasible to perform high-throughput genetic screens to
    isolate novel mutants that are impaired in sensing or transducing signals
    downstream of the putative UVB photoreceptor(s).

    Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding
    cis-regulatory elements, of which the identification remains an on-going
    challenge owing to the prevalence of large numbers of non-functional TF
    binding sites. Powerful comparative genomics methods, such as phylogenetic
    footprinting, can be used for the detection of conserved non-coding
    sequences (CNSs), which are functionally constrained and can greatly help in
    reducing the number of false-positive elements. In this study, we applied a
    phylogenetic footprinting approach for the identification of CNSs in ten
    dicot plants, yielding 1,032,291 CNSs associated with 243,187 genes. To
    annotate CNSs with TFBSs, we made use of binding site information of 642 TFs
    originating from 35 TF families in Arabidopsis. In three species, the
    identified CNSs were evaluated using TF chromatin immunoprecipitation
    sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data resulting in significant overlap for the majority
    of datasets. To identify ultra-conserved CNSs, we included genomes of
    additional plant families and identified 715 binding sites for 501 genes
    conserved in dicots, monocots, mosses and green algae. Additionally, we
    found that genes part of conserved mini-regulons have a higher coherence in
    their expression profile than other divergent gene pairs. All identified
    CNSs were integrated in the PLAZA 3.0 Dicots comparative genomics platform
    (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v3_dicots/)
    together with new functionalities facilitating the exploration of conserved
    cis-regulatory elements and their associated genes. The availability of this
    dataset in a user-friendly platform enables the exploration of functional
    non-coding DNA to study gene regulation in a variety of plant species,
    including crops.

    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has caused a revolution in biology. NGS
    requires the preparation of libraries in which (fragments of) DNA or RNA
    molecules are fused with adapters followed by PCR amplification and
    sequencing. It is evident that robust library preparation methods that
    produce a representative, non-biased source of nucleic acid material from
    the genome under investigation are of crucial importance. Nevertheless, it
    has become clear that NGS libraries for all types of applications contain
    biases that compromise the quality of NGS datasets and can lead to their
    erroneous interpretation. A detailed knowledge of the nature of these biases
    will be essential for a careful interpretation of NGS data on the one hand
    and will help to find ways to improve library quality or to develop
    bioinformatics tools to compensate for the bias on the other hand. In this
    review we discuss the literature on bias in the most common NGS library
    preparation protocols, both for DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) as well as for RNA
    sequencing (RNA-seq). Strikingly, almost all steps of the various protocols
    have been reported to introduce bias, especially in the case of RNA-seq,
    which is technically more challenging than DNA-seq. For each type of bias we
    discuss methods for improvement with a view to providing some useful advice
    to the researcher who wishes to convert any kind of raw nucleic acid into an
    NGS library.

  abstract: >-
    Because of its importance to the arthropod exoskeleton, chitin biogenesis is
    an attractive target for pest control. This point is demonstrated by the
    economically important benzoylurea compounds that are in wide use as highly
    specific agents to control insect populations. Nevertheless, the target
    sites of compounds that inhibit chitin biogenesis have remained elusive,
    likely preventing the full exploitation of the underlying mode of action in
    pest management. Here, we show that the acaricide etoxazole inhibits chitin
    biogenesis in Tetranychus urticae (the two-spotted spider mite), an
    economically important pest. We then developed a population-level bulk
    segregant mapping method, based on high-throughput genome sequencing, to
    identify a locus for monogenic, recessive resistance to etoxazole in a
    field-collected population. As supported by additional genetic studies,
    including sequencing across multiple resistant strains and genetic
    complementation tests, we associated a nonsynonymous mutation in the major
    T. urticae chitin synthase (CHS1) with resistance. The change is in a
    C-terminal transmembrane domain of CHS1 in a highly conserved region that
    may serve a noncatalytic but essential function. Our finding of a
    target-site resistance mutation in CHS1 shows that at least one highly
    specific chitin biosynthesis inhibitor acts directly to inhibit chitin
    synthase. Our work also raises the possibility that other chitin biogenesis
    inhibitors, such as the benzoylurea compounds, may also act by inhibition of
    chitin synthases. More generally, our genetic mapping approach should be
    powerful for high-resolution mapping of simple traits (resistance or
    otherwise) in arthropods.

  abstract: >-
    Behaviour manipulation imposed by parasites is a fascinating phenomenon but
    our understanding is still very limited. We studied the interaction between
    a virus and the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi that attacks Drosophila
    larvae. Wasps usually refrain to lay eggs into already parasitized hosts
    (superparasitism avoidance). On the contrary, females infected by the
    Leptopilina boulardi Filamentous Virus (LbFV) are much more incline to
    superparasitize. Interestingly, the host-sharing induced by this behaviour
    modification leads to the horizontal transmission of the virus, thus
    increasing its fitness at the expense of that of the wasp. To better
    understand the mechanisms underlying this behaviour manipulation, we studied
    by RNA sequencing the meta-transcriptome of LbFV and the parasitic wasp both
    in the abdomen and in the head. We found that the abundance of viral
    transcripts was independent of the wasp strain but strongly differed between
    tissues. Based on the tissue pattern of expression, we identified a set of
    20 viral genes putatively involved in the manipulation process. In addition,
    we identified a set of wasp genes deregulated in the presence of the virus
    either in the abdomen or in the head, including genes with annotations
    suggesting involvement in behaviour (i.e. Potassium-channel protein). This
    dataset gives new insights into the behaviour manipulation and on the
    genetic basis of superparasitism in parasitoids.

    Energy homeostasis depends on insulin signaling in metazoans. Insulin levels
    reflect the nutritional status of the animal to control levels of
    circulating sugar and regulate storage of resources in the form of glycogen
    and fat. Over the past several years, evidence has begun to accumulate that
    insulin production and secretion, as well as cellular responsiveness to
    insulin, are subject to regulation by microRNAs. Here we present evidence
    that miR-14 acts in the insulin-producing neurosecretory cells in the adult
    Drosophila brain to control metabolism. miR-14 acts in these cells through
    its direct target, sugarbabe. sugarbabe encodes a predicted zinc finger
    protein that regulates insulin gene expression in the neurosecretory cells.
    Regulation of sugarbabe levels by nutrients and by miR-14 combines to allow
    the fly to manage resource mobilization in a nutritionally variable
    environment.

    The novel multi-million read generating sequencing technologies are very
    promising for resolving the immense soil 16S rRNA gene bacterial diversity.
    Yet they have a limited maximum sequence length screening ability,
    restricting studies in screening DNA stretches of single 16S rRNA gene
    hypervariable (V) regions. The aim of the present study was to assess the
    effects of properties of four consecutive V regions (V3-6) on commonly
    applied analytical methodologies in bacterial ecology studies. Using an in
    silico approach, the performance of each V region was compared with the
    complete 16S rRNA gene stretch. We assessed related properties of the soil
    derived bacterial sequence collection of the Ribosomal Database Project
    (RDP) database and concomitantly performed simulations based on published
    datasets. Results indicate that overall the most prominent V region for soil
    bacterial diversity studies was V3, even though it was outperformed in some
    of the tests. Despite its high performance during most tests, V4 was less
    conserved along flanking sites, thus reducing its ability for bacterial
    diversity coverage. V5 performed well in the non-redundant RDP database
    based analysis. However V5 did not resemble the full-length 16S rRNA gene
    sequence results as well as V3 and V4 did when the natural sequence
    frequency and occurrence approximation was considered in the virtual
    experiment. Although, the highly conserved flanking sequence regions of V6
    provide the ability to amplify partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from very
    diverse owners, it was demonstrated that V6 was the least informative
    compared to the rest examined V regions. Our results indicate that
    environment specific database exploration and theoretical assessment of the
    experimental approach are strongly suggested in 16S rRNA gene based
    bacterial diversity studies.

    The Roscoff Culture Collection (RCC, http://www. sb-roscoff.
    fr/Phyto/RCC/index. php) holds over 500 strains of marine cyanobacteria and
    microalgae with a strong emphasis on picoplankton, i. e. cells with size
    below 2-3 microns. Most of these strains have been obtained from the
    Equatorial Pacific, the Tropical Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red
    Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel. A large fraction of strains are
    characterized based on ultrastructure features, pigment analyses and SSU
    rDNA sequencing. With respect to prokaryotes, the RCC holds more than 100
    strains of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Both genera exhibit
    considerable ecotypic variability since they colonize virtually all oceanic
    waters from tropical oligotrophic regions to temperate coastal areas. These
    two cyanobacteria should receive increasing attention with the recent
    availability of complete genome sequences of four representative isolates.
    In recent years, we have also isolated novel picoeukaryotic strains from
    several algal classes (Prasinophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Bolidophyceae,
    Dictyochophyceae, Pelagophyceae...). As an example, we have now 20 strains
    of Ostreococcus (Prasinophyceae, Mamiellales), the smallest photosynthetic
    eukaryote initially isolated from Thau lagoon in France. These Ostreococcus
    strains originate from environments as diverse as the Red Sea or the coast
    of Brittany. We are currently extending our collection to heterotrophic
    picoplankton, since this compartment is probably very diversified, as
    revealed by recent molecular studies.

  abstract: >-
    Eusociality, the ultimate level of social organization, requires
    reproductive division of labor, and a sophisticated system of communication
    to maintain societal homeostasis. Reproductive division of labor is
    maintained by physiological differences between reproductive and sterile
    castes, typically dictated by pheromonal queen fertility signals that
    suppress worker reproduction. Intriguingly, reproduction and pheromonal
    signalling share regulatory machinery across insects.The gene Doublesex
    (Dsx) controls somatic sex determination and differentiation, including the
    development of ovaries and secondary sexual characteristics, such as
    pheromonal signalling. We hypothesized that this regulatory network was
    co-opted during eusocial evolution to regulate reproductive division of
    labor. Taking advantage of the breakdown in reproductive division of labor
    that occurs in honey bees when workers commence to lay eggs in the absence
    of a queen, we knocked down Dsx to observe effects on ovary development and
    fertility signal production. As expected, treated workers had lower levels
    of egg yolk protein, for which Dsx is a cis-regulatory enhancer in other
    insects, and greatly reduced ovary development. Also as expected, while
    control workers increased their levels of pheromonal fertility signals,
    treated workers did not, confirming the role of Dsx in regulating pheromone
    biosynthesis. We further found that Dsx is part of a large network enriched
    for regulatory proteins, which is also involved during early larval
    development, and upregulated in queen-destined larvae. Thus, the ancient
    developmental framework controlling sex specification and reproduction in
    solitary insects has been exapted for eusociality, forming the basis for
    reproductive division of labor and pheromonal signalling pathways.

  abstract: >-
    The wing polyphenism of pea aphids is a compelling laboratory model with
    which to study the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity. In
    this polyphenism, environmental stressors such as high aphid density cause
    asexual, viviparous adult female aphids to alter the developmental fate of
    their embryos from wingless to winged morphs. This polyphenism is
    transgenerational, in that the pea aphid mother experiences the
    environmental signals, but it is her offspring that are affected. Previous
    research suggested that the steroid hormone ecdysone may play a role in this
    polyphenism. Here, we analyzed ecdysone-related gene expression patterns and
    found that they were consistent with a down-regulation of the ecdysone
    pathway being involved in the production of winged offspring. We therefore
    predicted that reduced ecdysone signaling would result in more winged
    offspring. Experimental injections of ecdysone or its analog resulted in a
    decreased production of winged offspring. Conversely, interfering with
    ecdysone signaling using an ecdysone receptor antagonist or knocking down
    the ecdysone receptor gene with RNAi resulted in an increased production of
    winged offspring. Our results are therefore consistent with the idea that
    ecdysone plays a causative role in the regulation of the proportion of
    winged offspring produced in response to crowding in this polyphenism. Our
    results also show that an environmentally regulated maternal hormone can
    mediate phenotype production in the next generation, as well as provide
    significant insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning
    of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity.

  abstract: "Phenotypic plasticity is a key life history strategy used by many plants and animals living in heterogeneous environments. A multitude of studies have investigated the costs and limits of plasticity, as well as the conditions under which it evolves. Much less well understood are the molecular genetic mechanisms that enable an organism to sense its environment and respond in a plastic manner. The pea aphid wing polyphenism is a compelling laboratory model to study these mechanisms. In this polyphenism, environmental stressors like high density cause asexual, viviparous adult female aphids to change the development of their embryos from wingless to winged morphs. The life history trade-offs between the two morphs have been intensively studied, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. We therefore performed a genomewide study of the maternal transcriptome at two time points with and without a crowding stress to discover the maternal molecular changes that lead to the development of winged vs. wingless offspring. We observed significant transcriptional changes in genes associated with odorant binding, neurotransmitter transport, hormonal activity and chromatin remodelling in the maternal transcriptome. We also found that titres of serotonin, dopamine and octopamine were higher in solitary compared to crowded aphids. We use these results to posit a model for how\_maternal signals inform a developing embryo to be winged or wingless. Our findings add significant insights into the identity of the molecular mechanisms that underlie environmentally induced morph determination and suggest a possible role for biogenic amine regulation in polyphenisms generally."

    In Apis mellifera mellifera the ovary of a worker bee possesses on the
    average three to five ovarioles, although the maximum number may be much
    higher (up to 21). The development of the ovaries is influenced by several
    environmental factors and by innate factors as well. One of these innate
    factors is the number of ovarioles. In an experimental population of 50 the
    bees with the most highly developed ovaries have an inhibitory effect on
    ovarian development in the other bees. Résumé DÉVELOPPEMENT DE L'OVAIRE CHEZ
    LES OUVRIÈRES D'APIS MELLIFERA Le degré de développement des ovaires chez
    les ouvrières peut être un moyen d'apprécier la dominance de la reine et
    d'étudier la différenciation des castes. C'est dans cet esprit que ce
    travail a été entrepris, il a conduit aux remarques suivantes: 1 – Le nombre
    d'ovarioles par ovaire se répartit selon une courbe de fréquence
    dissymétrique. La moyenne arithmétrique du nombre d'ovarioles, pour des
    ouvrières de 5 colonies, est comprise entre 3,8 et 5,1; le nombre le plus
    fréquent est 3 ou 4, et le nombre maximum varie de 8 à 15. 2 – Le degré de
    développement de l'ovaire peut être estimé d'après l'état de différenciation
    et de croissance des ovocytes (ovogenèse) (fig. 2). 3 – Les facteurs qui
    influencent le développement de l'ovaire sont étudiés, Parmi ceux-ci il faut
    signaler l'influence saisonnière et l'effet d'un éclairement continu. 4 – On
    a établi qu'il existe une corrélation cntre le nombre d'ovarioles et le
    degré de développement de l'ovaire. 5 – Le problème de l'inhibition du
    développement de l'ovaire en présence d'ouvrières pondeuses est abordé. Les
    expériences réalisées mettent en évidence ce rôle inhibiteur.

    We describe a transgenesis platform for Drosophila melanogaster that
    integrates three recently developed technologies: a conditionally
    amplifiable bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), recombineering, and
    bacteriophage phi C31-mediated transgenesis. The BAC is maintained at low
    copy number, facilitating plasmid maintenance and recombineering, but is
    induced to high copy number for plasmid isolation. Recombineering allows gap
    repair and mutagenesis in bacteria. Gap repair efficiently retrieves DNA
    fragments up to 133 kilobases long from P1 or BAC clones. phi C31-mediated
    transgenesis integrates these large DNA fragments at specific sites in the
    genome, allowing the rescue of lethal mutations in the corresponding genes.
    This transgenesis platform should greatly facilitate structure/function
    analyses of most Drosophila genes.

    The popularity of Drosophila melanogaster as a model for understanding
    eukaryotic biology over the past 100 years has been accompanied by the
    development of numerous tools for manipulating the fruitfly genome. Here we
    review some recent technologies that will allow Drosophila melanogaster to
    be manipulated more easily than any other multicellular organism. These
    developments include the ability to create molecularly designed deletions,
    improved genetic mapping technologies, strategies for creating targeted
    mutations, new transgenic approaches and the means to clone and modify large
    fragments of DNA.

    The basic-leucine zipper protein Cap 'n' collar B (CncB) suppresses the
    segmental identity function of the Hox gene Deformed (Dfd) in the mandibular
    segment of Drosophila embryos. CncB is also required for proper development
    of intercalary, labral and mandibular structures. In this study, we provide
    evidence that the CncB-mediated suppression of Dfd requires the Drosophila
    homolog of the mammalian small Maf proteins, Maf-S, and that the suppression
    occurs even in the presence of high amounts of Dfd protein. Interestingly,
    the CncB/Maf-S suppressive effect can be partially reversed by
    overexpression of Homothorax (Hth), suggesting that Hth and Extradenticle
    proteins antagonize the effects of CncB/Maf-S on Dfd function in the
    mandibular segment. In embryos, multimers of simple CncB/Maf-S heterodimer
    sites are transcriptionally activated in response to CncB, and in tissue
    culture cells the amino-terminal domain of CncB acts as a strong
    transcriptional activation domain. There are no good matches to CncB/Maf
    binding consensus sites in the known elements that are activated in response
    to Dfd and repressed in a CncB-dependent fashion. This suggests that some of
    the suppressive effect of CncB/Maf-S proteins on Dfd protein function might
    be exerted indirectly, while some may be exerted by direct binding to as yet
    uncharacterized Dfd response elements. We also show that ectopic CncB is
    sufficient to transform ventral epidermis in the trunk into repetitive
    arrays of ventral pharynx. We compare the functions of CncB to those of its
    vertebrate and invertebrate homologs, p45 NF-E2, Nrf and Skn-1 proteins, and
    suggest that the pharynx selector function of CncB is highly conserved on
    some branches of the evolutionary tree.

    Modern developments in single cell sequencing technologies enable broad
    insights into cellular state. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be
    used to explore cell types, states, and developmental trajectories to
    broaden understanding of cell heterogeneity in tissues and organs. Analysis
    of these sparse, high-dimensional experimental results requires dimension
    reduction. Several methods have been developed to estimate low-dimensional
    embeddings for filtered and normalized single cell data. However, methods
    have yet to be developed for unfiltered and unnormalized count data. We
    present a nonlinear latent variable model with robust, heavy-tailed error
    and adaptive kernel learning to estimate low-dimensional nonlinear structure
    in scRNA-seq data. Gene expression in a single cell is modeled as a noisy
    draw from a Gaussian process in high dimensions from low-dimensional latent
    positions. This model is called the Gaussian process latent variable model
    (GPLVM). We model residual errors with a heavy-tailed Student's
    t-distribution to estimate a manifold that is robust to technical and
    biological noise. We compare our approach to common dimension reduction
    tools to highlight our model's ability to enable important downstream tasks,
    including clustering and inferring cell developmental trajectories, on
    available experimental data. We show that our robust nonlinear manifold is
    well suited for raw, unfiltered gene counts from high throughput sequencing
    technologies for visualization and exploration of cell states.

    Phenotypic plasticity is an environmentally based change in the phenotype.
    Understanding the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity has been
    hampered by dissenting opinions on the merits of different methods of
    description, on the underlying genetic mechanisms, and on the way that
    plasticity is affected by natural selection in a heterogeneous environment.
    During much of this debate, the authors of this article have held opposing
    views. Here, we attempt to lay out current issues and summarize the areas of
    consensus and controversy surrounding the evolution of plasticity and the
    reaction norm (the set of phenotypes produced by a genotype over a range of
    environments).

  abstract: >-
    Background: Codon usage bias (CUB), the uneven use of synonymous codons, is
    a ubiquitous observation in virtually all organisms examined. The pattern of
    codon usage is generally similar among closely related species, but differs
    significantly among distantly related organisms, e. g., bacteria, yeast, and
    Drosophila. Several explanations for CUB have been offered and some have
    been supported by observations and experiments, although a thorough
    understanding of the evolutionary forces (random drift, mutation bias, and
    selection) and their relative importance remains to be determined. The
    recently available complete genome DNA sequences of twelve phylogenetically
    defined species of Drosophila offer a hitherto unprecedented opportunity to
    examine these problems. We report here the patterns of codon usage in the
    twelve species and offer insights on possible evolutionary forces
    involved.Results: (1) Codon usage is quite stable across 11/12 of the
    species: G-and especially C-ending codons are used most frequently, thus
    defining the preferred codons. (2) The only amino acid that changes in
    preferred codon is Serine with six species of the melanogaster group
    favoring TCC while the other species, particularly subgenus Drosophila
    species, favor AGC. (3) D. willistoni is an exception to these
    generalizations in having a shifted codon usage for seven amino acids toward
    A/T in the wobble position. (4) Amino acids differ in their contribution to
    overall CUB, Leu having the greatest and Asp the least. (5) Among two-fold
    degenerate amino acids, A/G ending amino acids have more selection on codon
    usage than T/C ending amino acids. (6) Among the different chromosome arms
    or elements, genes on the non-recombining element F (dot chromosome) have
    the least CUB, while genes on the element A (X chromosome) have the most.
    (7) Introns indicate that mutation bias in all species is approximately 2:
    1, AT:GC, the opposite of codon usage bias. (8) There is also evidence for
    some overall regional bias in base composition that may influence codon
    usage.Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that natural selection has
    acted on codon usage in the genus Drosophila, at least often enough to leave
    a footprint of selection in modern genomes. However, there is evidence in
    the data that random forces (drift and mutation) have also left patterns in
    the data, especially in genes under weak selection for codon usage for
    example genes in regions of low recombination. The documentation of codon
    usage patterns in each of these twelve genomes also aids in ongoing
    annotation efforts.

    High-throughput short-read sequencing has revolutionized how transcriptomes
    are quantified and annotated. However, while Illumina short-read sequencers
    can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual
    splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these
    individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms.
    Because of this shortfall, long-distance information is required to
    complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of
    full-length RNA transcript isoforms. While long-read sequencing technology
    can provide this long-distance information, there are issues with both
    Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)
    long-read sequencing technologies that prevent their widespread adoption.
    Briefly, PacBio sequencers produce low numbers of reads with high accuracy,
    while ONT sequencers produce higher numbers of reads with lower accuracy.
    Here, we introduce and validate a long-read ONT-based sequencing method. At
    the same cost, our Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus
    (R2C2) method generates more accurate reads of full-length RNA transcript
    isoforms than any other available long-read sequencing method. These reads
    can then be used to generate isoform-level transcriptomes for both genome
    annotation and differential expression analysis in bulk or single-cell
    samples.

    As an unfortunate consequence of aerobic life, active oxygen species (AOS)
    are formed by partial reduction of molecular oxygen. Plants possess a
    complex battery of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants that can protect
    cells from oxidative damage by scavenging AOS. It is becoming evident that
    AOS, which are generated during pathogen attack and abiotic stress
    situations, are recognized by plants as a signal for triggering defence
    responses. An overview of the literature is presented on the signalling role
    of AOS in plant defence responses, cell death, and development. Special
    attention is given to AOS and redox-regulated gene expression and the role
    of kinases and phosphatases in redox signal transduction.

    Utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and an Escherichia coli expression
    system for bovine cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450, lysine
    residues at 377 and 381 are found to play crucial roles in binding bovine
    adrenodoxin, required for transfer of electrons to mitochondrial P450s.
    These lysine residues are conserved among mitochondrial P450s and have been
    implicated previously by chemical modification studies as being important
    for adrenodoxin binding. In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis
    producing either neutral or positive amino acids at 377 or 381 has no effect
    on the structure of side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 as determined
    spectrally or on the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone.
    However, the estimated K(S) of adrenodoxin binding is increased
    approximately 150-600-fold depending on the particular mutation. Therefore
    these conserved positively charged residues in mitochondrial P450s are the
    key sites for adrenodoxin binding which is electrostatic in nature.

    contribute appreciably to nonhematopoietic tissues, including brain, kidney,
    gut, liver, and muscle. Similarly, in GFP(+):GFP(-) parabiotic mice, we
    found substantial chimerism of hematopoietic but not nonhematopoietic cells.
    These data indicate that "transdifferentiation" of circulating HSCs and/or
    their progeny is an extremely rare event, if it occurs at all.

    Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often
    obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina
    sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical
    biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the
    RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected
    in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure.
    Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative
    molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the
    average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts
    mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property
    and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight
    modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for
    transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates
    statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.

  abstract: >-
    Dengue fever is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans
    with more than 50 million cases estimated annually in more than 100
    countries. Disturbingly, the geographic range of dengue is currently
    expanding and the severity of outbreaks is increasing. Control options for
    dengue are very limited and currently focus on reducing population abundance
    of the major mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. These strategies are failing to
    reduce dengue incidence in tropical communities and there is an urgent need
    for effective alternatives. It has been proposed that endosymbiotic
    bacterial Wolbachia infections of insects might be used in novel strategies
    for dengue control. For example, the wMelPop-CLA Wolbachia strain reduces
    the lifespan of adult A. aegypti mosquitoes in stably transinfected lines.
    This life-shortening phenotype was predicted to reduce the potential for
    dengue transmission. The recent discovery that several Wolbachia infections,
    including wMelPop-CLA, can also directly influence the susceptibility of
    insects to infection with a range of insect and human pathogens has markedly
    changed the potential for Wolbachia infections to control human diseases.
    Here we describe the successful transinfection of A. aegypti with the
    avirulent wMel strain of Wolbachia, which induces the reproductive phenotype
    cytoplasmic incompatibility with minimal apparent fitness costs and high
    maternal transmission, providing optimal phenotypic effects for invasion.
    Under semi-field conditions, the wMel strain increased from an initial
    starting frequency of 0.65 to near fixation within a few generations,
    invading A. aegypti populations at an accelerated rate relative to trials
    with the wMelPop-CLA strain. We also show that wMel and wMelPop-CLA strains
    block transmission of dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) in A. aegypti, forming the
    basis of a practical approach to dengue suppression.

    Background The ability to generate long sequencing reads and access
    long-range linkage information is revolutionizing the quality and
    completeness of genome assemblies. Here we use a hybrid approach that
    combines data from four genome sequencing and mapping technologies to
    generate a new genome assembly of the honeybee Apis mellifera. We first
    generated contigs based on PacBio sequencing libraries, which were then
    merged with linked-read 10x Chromium data followed by scaffolding using a
    BioNano optical genome map and a Hi-C chromatin interaction map,
    complemented by a genetic linkage map. Results Each of the assembly steps
    reduced the number of gaps and incorporated a substantial amount of
    additional sequence into scaffolds. The new assembly (Amel_HAv3) is
    significantly more contiguous and complete than the previous one (Amel_4.5),
    based on Sanger sequencing reads. N50 of contigs is 120-fold higher (5.381
    Mbp compared to 0.053 Mbp) and we anchor >98% of the sequence to
    chromosomes. All of the 16 chromosomes are represented as single scaffolds
    with an average of three sequence gaps per chromosome. The improvements are
    largely due to the inclusion of repetitive sequence that was unplaced in
    previous assemblies. In particular, our assembly is highly contiguous across
    centromeres and telomeres and includes hundreds of AvaI and AluI repeats
    associated with these features. Conclusions The improved assembly will be of
    utility for refining gene models, studying genome function, mapping
    functional genetic variation, identification of structural variants, and
    comparative genomics.

    Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been found to widely exist in
    eukaryotes and play important roles in key biological processes. To extend
    our knowledge of lncRNAs in crop plants we performed both non-directional
    and strand-specific RNA-sequencing experiments to profile non-coding
    transcriptomes of various rice and maize organs at different developmental
    stages. Analysis of more than 3 billion reads identified 22 334 long
    intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and 6673 pairs of sense and natural
    antisense transcript (NAT). Many lincRNA genes were associated with
    epigenetic marks. Expression of rice lincRNA genes was significantly
    correlated with that of nearby protein-coding genes. A set of NAT genes also
    showed expression correlation with their sense genes. More than 200 rice
    lincRNA genes had homologous non-coding sequences in the maize genome. Much
    more lincRNA and NAT genes were derived from conserved genomic regions
    between the two cereals presenting positional conservation. Protein-coding
    genes flanking or having a sense-antisense relationship to these conserved
    lncRNA genes were mainly involved in development and stress responses,
    suggesting that the associated lncRNAs might have similar functions.
    Integrating previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we found that
    hundreds of lincRNAs contain trait-associated SNPs (single nucleotide
    polymorphisms [SNPs]) suggesting their putative contributions to
    developmental and agriculture traits.

    Human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) catalyzes the NADPH-cytochrome P450
    reductase-dependent oxidation of heme to biliverdin, CO, and free iron. The
    biliverdin is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.
    Earlier kinetic studies suggested that biliverdin reductase facilitates the
    release of biliverdin from hHO-1 (Liu, Y., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R.
    (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5297-5307). We have investigated the binding of
    P450 reductase and biliverdin reductase to truncated, soluble hHO-1 by
    fluorescence resonance energy transfer and site-specific mutagenesis. P450
    reductase and biliverdin reductase bind to truncated hHO-1 with
    K-d=0.4+/-0.1 and 0.2+/-0.1 muM, respectively. FRET experiments indicate
    that biliverdin reductase and P450 reductase compete for binding to
    truncated hHO-1. Mutation of surface ionic residues shows that hHO-1
    residues Lys(18), Lys(22), Lys(179), Arg(183), Arg(198), Glu(19), Glu(127),
    and Glu(190) contribute to the binding of cytochrome P450 reductase. The
    mutagenesis results and a computational analysis of the protein surfaces
    partially define the binding site for P450 reductase. An overlapping binding
    site including Lys(18), Lys(22), Lys(179), Arg(183), and Arg(185) is
    similarly defined for biliverdin reductase. These results confirm the
    binding of biliverdin reductase to hHO-1 and define binding sites of the two
    reductases.

    Rice branching, including the formation of tillers and panicle branches, has
    been well investigated over the past several years because of its agronomic
    importance. A major breakthrough in elucidating rice tillering in the recent
    years was the discovery of strigolactones, a specific group of terpenoid
    lactones that can inhibit axillary bud outgrowth. Since that discovery, new
    tillering mutants, that is, dwarf 27 (d27) or dwarf14 (d14, also reported as
    d88 or htd2), have been identified with reduced strigolactone levels or
    strigolactone response. DWARF27 (D27) and DWARF14 (D14) probably act on
    strigolactone biosynthesis and signal transduction, respectively.
    Additionally, several genes controlling panicle branches have been
    identified recently. DEP1 and IPA1/WFP are essential dominant/semidominant
    regulators that determine rice panicle branches and thus affect the grain
    yields. More importantly, dep1 and ipa1 alleles have been shown to be
    applicable for the improvement of rice grain yields in molecular breeding.

    Nutrition is one of the most influential environmental factors for
    development, function, and survival of all organisms. One of the central and
    most intriguing questions in social insect research is how nutrition and the
    environment can program the development of different reproductive castes.
    Since the honey bee, Apis mellifera, genome was sequenced in 2006,
    tremendous knowledge has been gained on how genomic biology and molecular
    mechanisms respond to nutrition. This review integrates insights gained from
    past and recent research on honey bee physiology, behaviour, developmental
    biology, genetics, and molecular biology. A wide range of topics are covered
    from nutrients and digestive enzymes, to molecular physiological signalling
    pathways, to feeding behaviour and nourishment, and to epigenetic mechanisms
    programming larval and adult development. Caste determination is the focus
    in larval development, and behavioural transition of adult workers is the
    focus in adult nutrition. A deeper understanding of social insects and their
    nutritional regulation at the genomic level is still needed. It is
    recommended that future work focus on dissecting the network and signalling
    pathways between epigenetic marks and endocrinological factors using the
    honey bee as an excellent model system.

    Environmental and genetic factors can modulate aggressiveness, but the
    biological mechanisms underlying their influence are largely unknown. Social
    experience with conspecifics suppresses aggressiveness in both vertebrate
    and invertebrate species, including Drosophila. We searched for genes whose
    expression levels correlate with the influence of social experience on
    aggressiveness in Drosophila by performing microarray analysis of head
    tissue from socially isolated (aggressive) vs. socially experienced
    (non-aggressive) male flies. Among approximate to 200 differentially
    expressed genes, only one was also present in a gene set previously
    identified by profiling Drosophila strains subjected to genetic selection
    for differences in aggressiveness [Dierick HA, Greenspan RJ (2006) Nat Genet
    38:1023-1031]. This gene, Cyp6a20, encodes a cytochrome P450. Social
    experience increased Cyp6a20 expression and decreased aggressiveness in a
    reversible manner. In Cyp6a20 mutants, aggressiveness was increased in
    group-housed but not socially isolated flies. These data identify a common
    genetic target for environmental and heritable influences on aggressiveness.
    Cyp6a20 is expressed in a subset of nonneuronal support cells associated
    with pheromone-sensing olfactory sensilla, suggesting that social experience
    may influence aggressiveness by regulating pheromone sensitivity.

    Grasses produce tiller and panicle branching at vegetative and reproductive
    stages; the branching patterns largely define the diversity of grasses and
    constitute a major determinant for grain yield of many cereals. Here we show
    that a spatiotemporally coordinated gene network consisting of the MicroRNA
    156 (miR156/)miR529/SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) and
    miR172/APETALA2 (AP2) pathways regulates tiller and panicle branching in
    rice. SPL genes negatively control tillering, but positively regulate
    inflorescence meristem and spikelet transition. Underproduction or
    overproduction of SPLs reduces panicle branching, but by distinct
    mechanisms: miR156 and miR529 fine-tune the SPL levels for optimal panicle
    size. miR172 regulates spikelet transition by targeting AP2-like genes,
    which does not affect tillering, and the AP2-like proteins play the roles by
    interacting with TOPLESS-related proteins (TPRs). SPLs modulate panicle
    branching by directly regulating the miR172/AP2 and PANICLE PHYTOMER2
    (PAP2)/Rice TFL1/CEN homolog 1 (RCN1) pathways and also by integrating other
    regulators, most of which are not involved in tillering regulation. These
    findings may also have significant implications for understanding branching
    regulation of other grasses and for application in rice genetic improvement.

    Abstract Oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in the development of
    diabetes, which has become a great threaten for health in the whole world.
    In recent years, it has been found that, in addition to the effect on
    metabolism, insulin plays an antioxidant role. However, the effect of
    insulin on the whole antioxidant enzyme system, especially in vivo, is not
    completely understood. We note that, in vitro and in vivo, insulin
    administration could sequentially and transiently increase a battery of
    antioxidant enzymes through the activation of the key transcription factor
    nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The sequential
    activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-protein kinase B
    (Akt) pathway maybe required for insulin-induced enhancement of antioxidant
    defense regulated by Nrf2. Our observation leads to the hypothesis that
    insulin regulates the redox balance and insulin bolsters antioxidant
    defenses via the ERK-Akt-Nrf2 pathway. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 16,

    Growth and development of a plant are controlled by programmed expression of
    suits of genes at the appropriate time, tissue and abundance. Although
    genomic resources have been developed rapidly in recent years in rice, a
    model plant for cereal genome research, data of gene expression profiling
    are still insufficient to relate the developmental processes to
    transcriptomes, leaving a large gap between the genome sequence and
    phenotype. In this study, we generated genome-wide expression data by
    hybridizing 190 Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Arrays with RNA from 39
    tissues collected throughout the life cycle of the rice plant from two
    varieties, Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63. Analyses of the global transcriptomes
    revealed many interesting features of dynamic patterns of gene expression
    across the tissues and stages. In total, 38 793 probe sets were detected as
    expressed and 69% of the expressed transcripts showed significantly variable
    expression levels among tissues/organs. We found that similarity of
    transcriptomes among organs corresponded well to their developmental
    relatedness. About 5.2% of the expressed transcripts showed tissue-specific
    expression in one or both varieties and 22.7% of the transcripts exhibited
    constitutive expression including 19 genes with high and stable expression
    in all the tissues. This dataset provided a versatile resource for plant
    genomic research, which can be used for associating the transcriptomes to
    the developmental processes, understanding the regulatory network of these
    processes, tracing the expression profile of individual genes and
    identifying reference genes for quantitative expression analyses.

    Background: Comprehensive, tissue-specific, microarray analysis is a potent
    tool for the identification of tightly defined expression patterns that
    might be missed in whole-organism scans. We applied such an analysis to
    Drosophila melanogaster Malpighian ( renal) tubule, a defined differentiated
    tissue.Results: The transcriptome of the D. melanogaster Malpighian tubule
    is highly reproducible and significantly different from that obtained from
    whole-organism arrays. More than 200 genes are more than 10-fold enriched
    and over 1,000 are significantly enriched. Of the top 200 genes, only 18
    have previously been named, and only 45% have even estimates of function. In
    addition, 30 transcription factors, not previously implicated in tubule
    development, are shown to be enriched in adult tubule, and their expression
    patterns respect precisely the domains and cell types previously identified
    by enhancer trapping. Of Drosophila genes with close human disease homologs,
    50 are enriched threefold or more, and eight enriched 10-fold or more, in
    tubule. Intriguingly, several of these diseases have human renal phenotypes,
    implying close conservation of renal function across 400 million years of
    divergent evolution.Conclusions: From those genes that are identifiable, a
    radically new view of the function of the tubule, emphasizing solute
    transport rather than fluid secretion, can be obtained. The results
    illustrate the phenotype gap: historically, the effort expended on a model
    organism has tended to concentrate on a relatively small set of processes,
    rather than on the spread of genes in the genome.

    The cultivation of rice in Africa dates back more than 3,000 years.
    Interestingly, African rice is not of the same origin as Asian rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) but rather is an entirely different species (i.e., Oryza
    glaberrima Steud.). Here we present a high-quality assembly and annotation
    of the O. glaberrima genome and detailed analyses of its evolutionary
    history of domestication and selection. Population genomics analyses of 20
    O. glaberrima and 94 Oryza barthii accessions support the hypothesis that O.
    glaberrima was domesticated in a single region along the Niger river as
    opposed to noncentric domestication events across Africa. We detected
    evidence for artificial selection at a genome-wide scale, as well as with a
    set of O. glaberrima genes orthologous to O. sativa genes that are known to
    be associated with domestication, thus indicating convergent yet independent
    selection of a common set of genes during two geographically and culturally
    distinct domestication processes.

    Exploitation of heterosis has brought significant advance in plant breeding
    and agricultural production, although its genetic basis is still poorly
    understood. In this study, a total of 66 chromosome segment substitution
    (CSS) lines, derived from a cross between japonica rice inbred line
    Asominori (as the recurrent parent) and indica rice inbred line IR24 (as the
    donor parent), were used to investigate the genetic basis of heterosis in
    indica × japonica inter-subspecific rice hybrids. Each CSS line was crossed
    with the background parent Asominori, and the heterosis of F(1) hybrids was
    estimated by comparing the F(1) performance with its two parental lines.
    Field experiments were carried out across six different environments to
    evaluate yield and yield-related traits in the 66 CSS lines and their 66
    corresponding F(1) hybrids. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses were
    conducted using a likelihood ratio test based on the stepwise regression.
    Thirty-six QTL were identified with significant effects in CSSL, 21 with
    significant effects in hybrids and 13 with significant effects in both. On
    the basis of average dominance degree, of all the 70 QTL affecting
    yield-related agronomic traits, 28.6% (20) showed an overdominance, 35.7%
    (25) a partial dominance and 30% (21) an additive effect, indicating that
    all effects contribute to trait variation in japonica-indica rice hybrids.
    Effects of these QTL were examined to identify Indica rice chromosome
    segments of interest for the improvement of japonica inbred lines and
    hybrids.

    Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a mitochondrial oxidoreductase, is released
    into the cytoplasm to induce cell death in response to apoptotic signals.
    However, the mechanisms underlying this process have not been resolved. We
    report that inactivation of the Caenorhabditis elegans AIF homolog wah-1 by
    RNA interference delayed the normal progression of apoptosis and caused a
    defect in apoptotic DNA degradation. WAH-1 localized in C. elegans
    mitochondria and was released into the cytosol and nucleus by the BH3-domain
    protein EGL-1 in a caspase (CED-3)-dependent manner. In addition, WAH-1
    associated and cooperated with the mitochondrial endonuclease
    CPS-6/endonuclease G (EndoG) to promote DNA degradation and apoptosis. Thus,
    AIF and EndoG de. ne a single, mitochondria-initiated apoptotic DNA
    degradation pathway that is conserved between C. elegans and mammals.

    We report the cloning and sequencing of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)
    gene from the housefly Musca domestica. A cDNA lambda-gt11 library was
    prepared from the organophosphate insecticide-resistant housefly strain
    Cornell-R -a variant that has elevated GST activity. The lambda-phage GST
    clone was identified on the basis of its ability to cross-hybridize to a GST
    DNA probe from Drosophila melanogaster. Based on amino acid homology to
    other GSTs and expression of GST activity in Escherichia coli, the Musca GST
    gene (MdGST-1) belongs to the GST gene family. Although organophosphate
    resistance in Cornell-R is largely due to one of the GSTs, MdGST-1 is
    probably not the enzyme responsible for resistance. The mutation that
    controls resistance to organophosphate insecticides in Cornell-R is highly
    unstable and we isolated spontaneous variants to both insecticide
    sensitivity and to even higher levels of resistance. This provided us with
    an isogenic set of three strains. We found that MdGST-1 transcript levels as
    measured by Northern assays are higher in all three Cornell-R strains
    relative to the sensitive wild type, but that the sensitive Cornell-R strain
    has more MdGST-1 transcript than does the highly resistant Cornell-R strain.
    These data as well as Southern analysis of genomic DNA allow us to conclude:
    (1) there are multiple GST genes in M. domestica; (2) the natural variant
    Cornell-R overproduces excess transcript from two and probably more of these
    genes; and (3) the unstable mutation in Cornell-R influences the levels of
    multiple GSTs.

    Plant architecture, a collection of the important agronomic traits that
    determine grain production in rice, is mainly affected by factors including
    tillering, plant height and panicle morphology. Recently, significant
    progress has been made in isolating and collecting of mutants that are
    defective in rice plant architecture. Although our understanding of the
    molecular mechanisms that control rice tillering, panicle development and
    plant height are still limited, new findings have begun to emerge. This
    review, therefore, summarizes the recent progress in exploring the
    mechanisms that control rice plant architecture.

    Biotransformation enzymes have been found in the olfactory epithelium of
    vertebrates, We now show that in Drosophila melanogaster, a
    UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT), as well as a short chain
    dehydrogenase/reductase and a cytochrome P450 are expressed specifically or
    preferentially in the olfactory organs, the antennae. The evolutionarily
    conserved expression of biotransformation enzymes in olfactory organs
    suggests that they play an important role in olfaction, In addition, we
    describe five Drosophila UGTs belonging to two families. All five UGTs
    contain a putative transmembrane domain at their C terminus as is the case
    for vertebrate UGTs where it is required for enzymatic activity, The primary
    sequence of the C terminus, including part of the transmembrane domain,
    differs between the two families but is highly conserved not only within
    each Drosophila family, but also between the members of one of the
    Drosophila families and vertebrate UGTs, The partial overlap of the
    conserved primary sequence with the transmembrane domain suggests that this
    part of the protein is involved in specific interactions occurring at the
    membrane surface. The presence of different C termini in the two Drosophila
    families suggests that they interact with different targets, one of which is
    conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates.

    The architecture of wheat (Triticum aestivum) inflorescence and its
    complexity is among the most important agronomic traits that influence
    yield. For example, wheat spikes vary considerably in the number of
    spikelets, which are specialized reproductive branches, and the number of
    florets, which are spikelet branches that produce seeds. The large and
    repetitive nature of the three homologous and highly similar subgenomes of
    wheat has impeded attempts at using genetic approaches to uncover beneficial
    alleles that can be utilized for yield improvement. Using a
    population-associative transcriptomic approach, we analyzed the
    transcriptomes of developing spikes in 90 wheat lines comprising 74 landrace
    and 16 elite varieties and correlated expression with variations in spike
    complexity traits. In combination with coexpression network analysis, we
    inferred the identities of genes related to spike complexity. Importantly,
    further experimental studies identified regulatory genes whose expression is
    associated with and influences spike complexity. The associative
    transcriptomic approach utilized in this study allows rapid identification
    of the genetic basis of important agronomic traits in crops with complex
    genomes.

    An understanding of the logic of odor perception requires a functional
    analysis of odor-evoked patterns of activity in neural assemblies in the
    brain. We have developed a sensitive imaging system in the Drosophila brain
    that couples two-photon microscopy with the specific expression of the
    calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein, G-CaMP. At natural odor
    concentration, each odor elicits a distinct and sparse spatial pattern of
    activity in the antennal lobe that is conserved in different flies. Patterns
    of glomerular activity are similar upon imaging of sensory and projection
    neurons, suggesting the faithful transmission of sensory input to higher
    brain centers. Finally, we demonstrate that the response pattern of a given
    glomerulus is a function of the specificity of a single odorant receptor.
    The development of this imaging system affords an opportunity to monitor
    activity in defined neurons throughout the fly brain with high sensitivity
    and excellent spatial resolution.

    Periodic pulses of the insect steroid molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone
    (20E), acting via its nuclear receptor complex (EcR/USP), control gene
    expression at many stages throughout Drosophila development. However, during
    the last larval instar of some lepidopteran insects, subtle changes in
    titers of ecdysteroids have been documented, including the so-called
    "commitment peak." This small elevation of 20E reprograms the larva for
    metamorphosis to the pupa. Similar periods of ecdysteroid immunoreactivity
    have been observed during the last larval instar of Drosophila. However, due
    to low amplitude and short duration, along with small body size and staging
    difficulties, their timing and ecdysteroid composition have remained
    uncertain. Employing a rigorous regimen of Drosophila culture and a salivary
    gland reporter gene, Sgs3-GFP, we used RP-HPLC and differential ecdysteroid
    RIA analysis to determine whole body titers of 20E during the last larval
    instar. Three small peaks of 20E were observed at 8, 20, and 28 hr following
    ecdysis, prior to the well-characterized large peak around the time of
    pupariation. The possible regulation of 20E levels by biosynthetic P450
    enzymes and the roles of these early peaks in coordinating gene expression
    and late larval development are discussed.

    Five different enzymatic activities, catalyzed by both microsomal and
    mitochondrial cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), are strongly implicated
    in the biosynthesis of ecdysone (E) from cholesterol. However, none of these
    enzymes have been characterized completely. The present data show that the
    wild-type genes of two members of the Halloween family of embryonic lethals,
    disembodied (dib) and shadow (sad), code for mitochondrial cytochromes P450
    that mediate the last two hydroxylation reactions in the ecdysteroidogenic
    pathway in Drosophila, namely the C22- and C2-hydroxylases. When sad
    (CYP315A1) is transfected into Drosophila S2 cells, the cells metabolize
    2-deoxyecdysone (2dE) to E and the [3H]ketotriol (2,22-dideoxyecdysone) to
    22-deoxyecdysone. In contrast, dib (CYP302A1) is responsible for the
    conversion of the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]2dE. When cells are transfected with
    both dib and sad, they metabolize the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]E in high yield.
    The expression of sad and dib is concentrated within the individual segments
    of the developing epidermis when there is a surge of ecdysteroid midway
    through embryogenesis. This result occurs before the ring gland has
    developed and suggests that the embryonic epidermis is a site of ecdysteroid
    biosynthesis. This pattern then diminishes, and, during late embryogenesis,
    expression of both genes is concentrated in the prothoracic gland cells of
    the developing ring gland. Expression of dib and sad continues to be
    localized in this endocrine compartment during larval development, being
    maximal in both the late second and third instar larvae, about the time of
    the premolt peaks in the ecdysteroid titer.

  abstract: >-
    We have reported recently the identification and characterization of the
    last three mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) controlling the
    biosynthesis of 20-hydroxyecdysone, the molting hormone of insects. These
    are encoded by the following genes: disembodied (dib, Cyp302a1, the
    22-hydroxylase); shadow (sad, Cyp315a1, the 2-hydroxylase); and shade (shd,
    Cyp314a1, the 20-hydroxylase). Employing similar gene identification and
    transfection techniques and subsequent biochemical analysis of the expressed
    enzymatic activity, we report the identity of the Drosophila gene phantom
    (phm), located at 17D1 of the X chromosome, as encoding the microsomal
    25-hydroxylase (Cyp306a1). Similar analysis following differential
    display-based gene identification has also resulted in the characterization
    of the corresponding 25-hydroxylase gene in Bombyx mori. Confirmation of
    2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone (3β,5β-ketodiol) conversion to 2,22-dideoxyecdysone
    (3β,5β-ketotriol) mediated by either Phm enzyme employed LC, MS and
    definitive NMR analysis. In situ developmental gene analysis, in addition to
    northern, western and RT-PCR techniques during Drosophila embryonic, larval
    and adult development, are consistent with this identification. That is,
    strong expression of phm is restricted to the prothoracic gland cells of the
    Drosophila larval ring gland, where it undergoes dramatic changes in
    expression, and in the adult ovary, but also in the embryonic epidermis.
    During the last larval–larval transition in Bombyx, a similar expression
    pattern in the prothoracic gland is observed, but as in Drosophila, slight
    expression is also present in other tissues, suggesting a possible
    additional role for the phantom enzyme.

    Odor coding in Drosophila is examined at both the cellular and molecular
    levels. Functional analysis of individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs)
    by single-unit electrophysiology has shown that ORNs divide into discrete
    classes, with each class exhibiting a characteristic odor response spectrum.
    Extensive analysis of ORNs in the maxillary palp has revealed six such
    classes, which are combined in sensilla according to a strict pairing rule.
    in order to identify the odor receptor genes that determine the odor
    specificity of these ORN classes, a new algorithm was designed to search DNA
    databases for proteins with a particular structure, as opposed to a
    particular sequence. The algorithm identified a large family of genes likely
    to encode odor receptors. The acj6 gene, originally identified in a screen
    for mutants defective in olfactory behavior, encodes a transcription factor
    that regulates a subset of these receptor genes, and is likely to play a
    critical role in the process by which ORNs select which receptors to
    express.

    The rice genome annotation has been greatly improved in recent years,
    largely due to the availability of full length cDNA sequences derived from
    many tissues. Among those yet to be studied is the aleurone layer, which
    produces hydrolases for mobilization of seed storage reserves during seed
    germination and post germination growth. Herein, we report transcriptomes of
    aleurone cells treated with the hormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, or
    both. Using a comprehensive approach, we identified hundreds of novel genes.
    To minimize the number of false positives, only transcripts that did not
    overlap with existing annotations, had a high level of expression, and
    showed a high level of uniqueness within the rice genome were considered to
    be novel genes. This approach led to the identification of 553 novel genes
    that encode proteins and/or microRNAs. The transcriptome data reported here
    will help to further improve the annotation of the rice genome.

    The sequencing of the second mosquito genome, Aedes aegypti, in addition to
    Anopheles gambiae, is a major milestone that will drive molecular-level and
    genome-wide high-throughput studies of not only these but also other
    mosquito vectors of human pathogens. Here we overview the ancestry of the
    mosquito genes, list the major expansions of gene families that may relate
    to species adaptation processes, as exemplified by CYP9 cytochrome P450
    genes, and discuss the conservation of chromosomal gene arrangements among
    the two mosquitoes and fruit fly. Many more invertebrate genomes are
    expected to be sequenced in the near future, including additional vectors of
    human pathogens (see www.vectorbase.org), and further comparative analyses
    will become increasingly refined and informative, hopefully improving our
    understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypical differences among these
    species, their vectorial capacity, and ultimately leading to the development
    of novel disease control strategies.

    The widespread use of genome-wide diagnostic screening methods has greatly
    increased the frequency with which incidental (but possibly pathogenic) copy
    number changes affecting single genes are detected. These findings require
    validation to allow appropriate clinical management. Deletion variants can
    usually be readily validated using a range of short-read next-generation
    sequencing (NGS) strategies, but the characterization of duplication
    variants at nucleotide resolution remains challenging. This presents
    diagnostic problems, since pathogenicity cannot generally be assessed
    without knowing the structure of the variant. We have used a novel Cas9
    enrichment strategy, in combination with long-read single-molecule nanopore
    sequencing, to address this need. We describe the nucleotide-level
    resolution of two problematic cases, both of whom presented with
    neurodevelopmental problems and were initially investigated by array CGH. In
    the first case, an incidental 1.7-kb imbalance involving a partial
    duplication of VHL exon 3 was detected. This variant was inherited from the
    patient’s father, who had a history of renal cancer at 38 years. In the
    second case, an incidental ~200-kb de novo duplication that included DMD
    exons 30–44 was resolved. In both cases, the long-read data yielded
    sufficient information to enable Sanger sequencing to define the
    rearrangement breakpoints, and creation of breakpoint-spanning PCR assays
    suitable for testing of relatives. Our Cas9 enrichment and nanopore
    sequencing approach can be readily adopted by molecular diagnostic
    laboratories for cost-effective and rapid characterization of challenging
    duplication-containing alleles. We also anticipate that in future this
    method may prove useful for characterizing acquired translocations in tumor
    cells, and for precisely identifying transgene integration sites in mouse
    models.

    Strains of the housefly, Musca domestica, highly resistant to
    organophosphate (OP) and other insecticides are known because they
    overproduce glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Previous work has shown that
    overproduction in these strains involved numerous isozymes with glutathione
    conjugating activities (Pesticide Biochem. Physiol., 25 (1986) 169; Mol.
    General Genetics, 227 (1991) 355; J. Biol. Chem., 267 (1992) 1840; Mol.
    General Genetics, 245 (1994) 236; J. Mol. Evol., 43 (1996) 236). The current
    work describes the purification and identification of a M. domestica GST
    isozyme (pI 7.1) broadly specific for substrates from a housefly strain,
    Cornell-HR, that is highly resistant against OP-insecticides, and the
    isolation of two new MdGST genes using the antibody made against it. This
    isozyme, which was identified from amongst more than 20 isoelectric forms of
    GSTs of the same subunit size, was highly active for conjugating GSH to the
    model substrate 3,4-dichloronitrobenzne (DCNB). When expressed in
    Escherichia coli, one of the cloned GSTs, MdGST-6A, produces an enzyme that
    conjugates glutathione to the insecticides methyl parathion and lindane. On
    indication that it was the most active isozyme toward several xenobiotics
    among several MdGSTs tested, we advance the notion that MdGST-6A probably
    plays an important role in M. domestica Cornell-HR's resistance towards
    OP-insecticides. MdGST-6A and a second closely related one found in this
    work, MdGST-6B, are members of the traditional insect class I family
    (theta-class) and share the greatest homologies with a cluster of Drosophila
    GSTs on locus 55. In addition to having the unusually broad substrate
    specificity, the sequence of the new group of enzymes reveals that it has a
    highly diverged hydrophobic motif in its active site as compared to other
    class I GSTs from insects. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

    Genomic analyses often involve scanning for potential transcription factor
    (TF) binding sites using models of the sequence specificity of DNA binding
    proteins. Many approaches have been developed to model and learn a protein's
    DNA-binding specificity, but these methods have not been systematically
    compared. Here we applied 26 such approaches to in vitro protein binding
    microarray data for 66 mouse TFs belonging to various families. For nine
    TFs, we also scored the resulting motif models on in vivo data, and found
    that the best in vitro–derived motifs performed similarly to motifs derived
    from the in vivo data. Our results indicate that simple models based on
    mononucleotide position weight matrices trained by the best methods perform
    similarly to more complex models for most TFs examined, but fall short in
    specific cases (<10% of the TFs examined here). In addition, the
    best-performing motifs typically have relatively low information content,
    consistent with widespread degeneracy in eukaryotic TF sequence preferences.

    Dispersed microfossils (spores and phytodebris) provide the earliest
    evidence for land plants. They are first reported from the Llanvirn
    (Mid-Ordovician). More or less identical assemblages occur from the Llanvirn
    (Mid-Ordovician) to the late Llandovery (Early Silurian), suggesting a
    period of relative stasis some 40 Myr in duration. Various lines of evidence
    suggest that these early dispersed microfossils derive from parent plants
    that were bryophyte-like if not in fact bryophytes. In the late Llandovery
    (late Early Silurian) there was a major change in the nature of dispersed
    spore assemblages as the separated products of dyads (hilate monads) and
    tetrads (trilete spores) became relatively abundant. The inception of
    trilete spores probably represents the appearance of vascular plants or
    their immediate progenitors. A little later in time, in the Wenlock (early
    Late Silurian), the earliest unequivocal land plant megafossils occur. They
    are represented by rhyniophytoids. It is only from the Late Silurian onwards
    that the microfossil/ megafossil record can be integrated and utilized in
    interpretation of the flora. Dispersed microfossils are preserved in vast
    numbers, in a variety of environments, and have a reasonable spatial and
    temporal fossil record. The fossil record of plant megafossils by comparison
    is poor and biased, with only a dozen or so known pre-Devonian assemblages.
    In this paper, the early land plant microfossil record, and its
    interpretation, are reviewed. New discoveries, novel techniques and fresh
    lines of inquiry are outlined and discussed.

    Gene duplication provides essential material for functional divergence of
    proteins and hence allows organisms to adapt to changing environments.
    Following duplication events, redundant paralogs may undergo different
    evolutionary paths via processes known as nonfunctionalization,
    neofunctionalization, or subfunctionalization. Studies of adaptive evolution
    at the molecular level have progressed rapidly by computationally analyzing
    nucleotide substitution patterns but such studies are limited by the absence
    of information relating to alterations of function of the encoded enzymes.
    In this respect, evolution of the Papilio polyxenes cytochrome P450
    monooxygenases (P450s) responsible for the adaptation of this insect to
    furanocoumarin-containing host plants provides an excellent model for
    elucidating the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes. Evidence from
    sequence and functional analysis in combination with molecular modeling
    indicates that the paralogous CYP6B1 and CYP6B3 genes in P. polyxenes have
    probably evolved via subfunctionalization after the duplication event by
    which they arose. Both enzymes have been under independent purifying
    selection as evidenced by the low dN/dS ratio in both the coding region and
    substrate recognition sites. Both enzymes have maintained their ability to
    metabolize linear and angular furanocoumarins albeit at different
    efficiencies. Comparisons of molecular models developed for the CYP6B3 and
    CYP6B1 proteins highlight differences in their binding modes that account
    for their different activities toward linear and angular furanocoumarins.
    That P. polyxenes maintains these 2 furanocoumarin-metabolizing loci with
    somewhat different activities and expression patterns provides this species
    with the potential to acquire P450s with novel functions while maintaining
    those most critical to its exclusive feeding on its current range of host
    plants.

  abstract: >-
    CYP6B1 represents the principal cytochrome P450 monooxygenase responsible
    for metabolizing furanocoumarins in Papilio polyxenes, an insect that
    specializes on host plants containing these toxins. Investigations of the
    amino acids responsible for the efficient metabolism of these plant toxins
    has identified Ile115 as one that modulates the rate of furanocoumarin
    metabolism even though it is predicted to be positioned at the edge of the
    heme plane and outside substrate contact regions. In contrast to previous
    expression studies conducted under conditions of limiting P450 reductase
    showing that the Ile115-to-Leu replacement enhances turnover of xanthotoxin
    and other furanocoumarins, studies conducted at high P450 reductase indicate
    that the Ile115-to-Leu replacement reduces turnover of these substrates.
    Further analysis of substrate binding affinities, heme spin state and NADPH
    consumption rates indicate that, whereas the I115L replacement mutant
    displays higher substrate affinity and heme spin state than the wild-type
    CYP6B1 protein, it utilizes NADPH more slowly than the wild-type CYP6B1
    protein at high P450 reductase levels. Molecular models developed for the
    wild-type CYP6B1 and mutant protein suggest that more constricted channels
    extending from the catalytic site in the I115L mutant to the P450 surface
    limit the rate of product release from this mutant catalytic site under
    conditions not limited by the rate of electron transfer from NADPH.

  abstract: >-
    Cytochrome P450 proteins, named for the absorption band at 450 nm of their
    carbon-monoxide-bound form, are one of the largest superfamilies of enzyme
    proteins. The P450 genes (also called CYP) are found in the genomes of
    virtually all organisms, but their number has exploded in plants. Their
    amino-acid sequences are extremely diverse, with levels of identity as low
    as 16% in some cases, but their structural fold has remained the same
    throughout evolution. P450s are heme-thiolate proteins; their most conserved
    structural features are related to heme binding and common catalytic
    properties, the major feature being a completely conserved cysteine serving
    as fifth (axial) ligand to the heme iron. Canonical P450s use electrons from
    NAD(P)H to catalyze activation of molecular oxygen, leading to regiospecific
    and stereospecific oxidative attack of a plethora of substrates. The
    reactions carried out by P450s, though often hydroxylation, can be extremely
    diverse and sometimes surprising. They contribute to vital processes such as
    carbon source assimilation, biosynthesis of hormones and of structural
    components of living organisms, and also carcinogenesis and degradation of
    xenobiotics. In plants, chemical defense seems to be a major reason for P450
    diversification. In prokaryotes, P450s are soluble proteins. In eukaryotes,
    they are usually bound to the endoplasmic reticulum or inner mitochondrial
    membranes. The electron carrier proteins used for conveying reducing
    equivalents from NAD(P)H differ with subcellular localization. P450 enzymes
    catalyze many reactions that are important in drug metabolism or that have
    practical applications in industry; their economic impact is therefore
    considerable.

    The complex, geometric colour patterns of many animal bodies have important
    roles in behaviour and ecology. The generation of certain patterns has been
    the subject of considerable theoretical exploration, however, very little is
    known about the actual mechanisms underlying colour pattern formation or
    evolution. Here we have investigated the generation and evolution of the
    complex, spotted wing pattern of Drosophila guttifera. We show that wing
    spots are induced by the Wingless morphogen, which is expressed at many
    discrete sites that are specified by pre-existing positional information
    that governs the development of wing structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate
    that the elaborate spot pattern evolved from simpler schemes by co-option of
    Wingless expression at new sites. This example of a complex design
    developing and evolving by the layering of new patterns on pre-patterns is
    likely to be a general theme in other animals.

    Wolbachia are common intracellular bacteria that are found in arthropods and
    nematodes. These alphaproteobacteria endosymbionts are transmitted
    vertically through host eggs and alter host biology in diverse ways,
    including the induction of reproductive manipulations, such as feminization,
    parthenogenesis, male killing and sperm–egg incompatibility. They can also
    move horizontally across species boundaries, resulting in a widespread and
    global distribution in diverse invertebrate hosts. Here, we review the basic
    biology of Wolbachia, with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding
    of these fascinating endosymbionts.

  abstract: >-
    Some insects are infected with maternally inherited bacterial endosymbionts
    that protect them against pathogens or parasitoids. The weevil Sitona
    obsoletus (=Sitona lepidus) is invasive in New Zealand, and suspected to
    contain such defensive symbionts, because it is particularly resistant to a
    Moroccan strain of the parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides (which
    successfully attacks many other weevil species), and shows geographic
    variation in susceptibility to an Irish strain of the same parasitoid. Using
    454 pyrosequencing, we investigated the bacterial community associated with
    S. obsoletus, two other exotic weevils (Sitona discoideus and Listronotus
    bonariensis) and two endemic New Zealand weevils (Irenimus aequalis and
    Steriphus variabilis). We found that S. obsoletus was infected by one strain
    of Wolbachia and two strains of Rickettsia, none of which were found in any
    other weevil species examined. Using diagnostic PCR, we found that S.
    obsoletus in the Northland region, where parasitism is highly variable, were
    primarily infected with Wolbachia and Rickettsia strain 2, indicating that
    these two symbionts should be investigated for potential defensive
    properties. In comparison, S. discoideus lacked any apparent maternally
    inherited bacterial endosymbionts. In the other weevil species, we found a
    different strain of Wolbachia and two different strains of Spiroplasma. Two
    weevil species (St. variabilis and L. bonariensis) were infected with
    distinct strains of Nardonella, the ancestral endosymbiont of weevils,
    whereas three weevil species (S. obsoletus, S. discoideus, and I. aequalis)
    lacked evidence for Nardonella infection. However, I. aequalis was
    consistently infected with a novel Enterobacteriaceae strain, suggesting
    that a symbiont replacement may have taken place, similar to that described
    for other weevil clades.

    Retinoids, particularly all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). are potent regulators
    of cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, The role of
    all-trans-RA during development and in the maintenance of adult tissues has
    been well established. The control of all-trans-RA levels in cells and
    tissues is regulated by the balance between its biosynthesis and its
    catabolism to inactive metabolites. The cytochrome P450 enzyme P450RAI
    (herein renamed P450RAI-1) is partially responsible for this inactivation of
    all-trans-RA. In this report. we describe the identification, molecular
    cloning. and characterization of a second related enzyme, P450RAI-2, which
    is also involved in the specific inactivation of all-trans-RA, Transiently
    transfected P45DRAI-2 can convert all-trans-RA to more polar metabolites
    including 4-oxo-, 4-OH-, and 18-OH-all-trans-RA. Competition experiments
    with other retinoids suggest that all-trans-RA is the preferred substrate.
    The high level of expression of P450RAI-2, particularly in the cerebellum
    and pens of human adult brain, suggests a unique role for this enzyme in the
    protection of specific tissues from exposure to retinoids.

    Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), a method to identify genetic variants and
    quickly genotype samples, reduces genome complexity by using restriction
    enzymes to divide the genome into fragments whose ends are sequenced on
    short-read sequencing platforms. While cost-effective, this method produces
    extensive missing data and requires complex bioinformatics analysis. GBS is
    most commonly used on crop plant genomes, and because crop plants have
    highly variable ploidy and repeat content, the performance of GBS analysis
    software can vary by target organism. Here we focus our analysis on soybean,
    a polyploid crop with a highly duplicated genome, relatively little public
    GBS data and few dedicated tools.

    The Illumina DNA sequencing platform generates accurate but short reads,
    which can be used to produce accurate but fragmented genome assemblies.
    Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies DNA sequencing
    platforms generate long reads that can produce complete genome assemblies,
    but the sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is significant
    interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies
    to generate more accurate “hybrid” assemblies. However, few tools exist that
    truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of
    short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we
    present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a
    combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are
    accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly
    graph from short reads using the de novo assembler SPAdes and then
    simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler
    uses a novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly graph.
    Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger
    contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when
    long-read depth and accuracy are low. Unicycler is open source (GPLv3) and
    available at github.com/rrwick/Unicycler.

    Stabilized lipid (cuticulin), combined with protein, serves to stiffen the
    cuticle before sclerotization occurs. It is always present in large amounts
    in exocuticle that will later be tanned to form sclerotin. It is plentiful
    also in the untanned mesocuticle, including the tracheal taenidia, as well
    as pore canals, egg shell and spermatophore sheath. Stabilized lipid present
    in small amounts between the laminae of the endocuticle may perhaps be
    concerned in reversible stiffening and plasticisation. The oenocytes appear
    to be the source of the precursors for cuticulin formation in both larva and
    reproducing adult.

    CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2 are responsible for the
    oxidative metabolism of more than 90% of marketed drugs. Cytochrome P450 3A4
    ( CYP3A4) metabolizes more drug molecules than all other isoforms combined.
    Here we report three crystal structures of CYP3A4: unliganded, bound to the
    inhibitor metyrapone, and bound to the substrate progesterone. The
    structures revealed a surprisingly small active site, with little
    conformational change associated with the binding of either compound. An
    unexpected peripheral binding site is identified, located above a
    phenylalanine cluster, which may be involved in the initial recognition of
    substrates or allosteric effectors.

    The Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) (Coleoptera:
    Curculionidae), is an important introduced pasture pest in New Zealand. In
    this study geographical populations of this species were analysed using
    polymerase chain reaction-based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD),
    in an attempt to determine the geographical origin of the pest.
    Morphologically indistinguishable individuals were collected from nine South
    American, five New Zealand and one Australian populations. Ten primers were
    screened for usefulness, two of which revealed significant, scorable
    polymorphisms between these populations. The results indicated that the
    sampled New Zealand L. bonariensis populations originated from the east
    coast of South America.

    Queen health is crucial to colony survival of social bees. Recently, queen
    failure has been proposed to be a major driver of managed honey bee colony
    losses, yet few data exist concerning effects of environmental stressors on
    queens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that exposure to
    field-realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides during
    development can severely affect queens of western honey bees (Apis
    mellifera). In pesticide-exposed queens, reproductive anatomy (ovaries) and
    physiology (spermathecal-stored sperm quality and quantity), rather than
    flight behaviour, were compromised and likely corresponded to reduced queen
    success (alive and producing worker offspring). This study highlights the
    detriments of neonicotinoids to queens of environmentally and economically
    important social bees, and further strengthens the need for stringent risk
    assessments to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services that are
    vulnerable to these substances.

    The Argentine stem weevil is a serious pest of pasture and other
    graminaceous crops in New Zealand. Fifteen populations from South America,
    New Zealand and Australia were examined in an effort to determine the
    geographical origin of the species in New Zealand. Our previously reported
    RAPD analysis of these populations (Williams et al., 1994) revealed that the
    source of the pest was the Rio de la Plata on the east coast of South
    America. As a second approach to examining genetic variation, RFLP analysis
    of the mitochondrial genome, using the digoxigenin-labelled boll weevil
    mitochondrial genome as a probe, was also performed. The mitochondrial
    analysis revealed that the species possesses an unusually large
    mitochondrial genome of 32 kb, which exhibits extremely low levels of
    polymorphism both in the introduced and native populations. This low
    variation is in contrast with the informative level of inter- and
    intrapopulation variation revealed by RAPD.

    Cytochrome P450s have generally been acknowledged as broadly tuned
    detoxifying enzymes. However, emerging evidence,argues P450s have an
    integral role in cell signaling and developmental processes, via their
    metabolism of retinoic acid, arachidonic acid, steroids, and other cellular
    ligands. To study the morphogenesis of Drosophila sensory organs, we
    examined mutants with impaired mechanosensation and discovered one, nompH,
    encodes the cytochrome P450 CYP303a1. We now report the characterization of
    nompH, a mutant defective in the function of peripheral chemo- and
    mechanoreceptor cells, and demonstrate CYP303a1 is essential for the
    development and structure of external sensory organs which mediate the
    reception of vital mechanosensory and chemosensory stimuli. Notably this
    P450 is expressed only in sensory bristles, localizing in the apical region
    of the socket cell. The wide diversity of the P450 family and the growing
    number of P450s with developmental phenotypes suggests the exquisite tissue
    and subcellular specificity of CYP303a1 illustrates an important aspect of
    P450 function; namely, a strategy to process critical developmental signals
    in a tissue- and cell-specific manner. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

    Modifications of metabolic pathways are important in insecticide resistance
    evolution. Mutations leading to changes in expression levels or substrate
    specificities of cytochrome P450 (P450), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and
    esterase genes have been linked to many cases of resistance with the
    responsible enzyme shown to utilize the insecticide as a substrate. Many
    studies show that the substrates of enzymes are capable of inducing the
    expression of those enzymes. We investigated if this was the case for
    insecticides and the enzymes responsible for their metabolism. The induction
    responses for P450s, GSTs and esterases to six different insecticides were
    investigated using a custom designed microarray in Drosophila melanogaster.
    Even though these gene families can all contribute to insecticide
    resistance, their induction responses when exposed to insecticides are
    minimal. The insecticides spinosad, diazinon, nitenpyram, lufenuron and
    dicyclanil did not induce any P450, GST or esterase gene expression after a
    short exposure to high lethal concentrations of insecticide. DDT elicited
    the low-level induction of one GST and one P450. These results are in
    contrast to induction responses we observed for the natural plant compound
    caffeine and the barbituate drug phenobarbital, both of which highly induced
    a number of P450 and GST genes under the same short exposure regime. Our
    results indicate that, under the insecticide exposure conditions we used,
    constitutive over-expression of metabolic genes play more of a role in
    insect survival than induction of members of these gene families. (c) 2006

  abstract: >-
    Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is an insecticide synergist known to inhibit the
    activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. PBO is currently used in some
    insecticide formulations, and has also been suggested as a pretreatment for
    some pesticide applications. Little is known about how insects respond to
    PBO exposure at the gene transcription level. The authors have characterised
    the transcriptional response of the Drosophila melanogaster genome after PBO
    treatment, using both a custom-designed 'detox' microarray, containing
    cytochrome P450 (P450), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase genes,
    and a full genome microarray. A subset of P450 and GST genes is identified,
    along with additional metabolic genes, that are induced by PBO. The gene set
    is an extremely similar gene set to that induced by phenobarbital, a
    compound for which pretreatment is known to confer tolerance to a range of
    insecticide compounds. The implications of the induction of gene families
    known to metabolise insecticides and the use of PBO in pest management
    programs are discussed. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

    Limited life span and senescence are near-universal characteristics of
    eukaryotic organisms, controlled by many interacting quantitative trait loci
    (QTL) with individually small effects, whose expression is sensitive to the
    environment. Analyses of mutations in model organisms have shown that genes
    affecting stress resistance and metabolism affect life span across diverse
    taxa. However, there is considerable segregating variation for life span in
    nature, and relatively little is known about the genetic basis of this
    variation. Replicated lines of Drosophila that have evolved increased
    longevity as a correlated response to selection for postponed senescence are
    valuable resources for identifying QTL affecting naturally occurring
    variation in life span. Here, we used deficiency complementation mapping to
    identify at least 11 QTL on chromosome 3 that affect variation in life span
    between five old (O) lines selected for postponed senescence and their five
    base (B) population control lines. Most QTL were sex specific, and all but
    one affected multiple O lines. The latter observation is consistent with
    alleles at intermediate frequency in the base population contributing to the
    response to selection for postponed senescence. The QTL were mapped with
    high resolution and contained from 12 to 170 positional candidate genes.

    Genetic changes in insects that lead to insecticide resistance include point
    mutations and upregulation/amplification of detoxification genes. Here, we
    report a third mechanism, resistance caused by an absence of gene product.
    Mutations of the Methoprene-tolerant (Met) gene of Drosophila melanogaster
    result in resistance to both methoprene, a juvenile hormone (JH) agonist
    insecticide, and JH. Previous results have demonstrated a mechanism of
    resistance involving an intracellular JH binding protein that has reduced
    ligand affinity in Met flies. We show that a gamma-ray induced allele,
    Met(27), completely lacks Met transcript during the insecticide-sensitive
    period in development. Although Met(27) homozygotes have reduced oogenesis,
    they are viable, demonstrating that Met is not a vital gene. Most
    target-site resistance genes encode vital proteins and thus have few
    mutational changes that permit both resistance and viability. In contrast,
    resistance genes such as Met that encode nonvital insecticide target
    proteins fan have a variety of mutational changes that result in an absence
    of functional gene product and thus should show higher rates of resistance
    evolution.

    Insects, including Drosophila, readily respond to toxins such as
    phytotoxins, metal ions, and insecticides in their environment by evolving
    resistance. Although Drosophila are seldom targets for insecticides,
    nevertheless populations worldwide have evolved resistance to a variety of
    insecticides, and these resistance alleles persist in high frequency. In
    many cases, Drosophila use the same genetic and biochemical mechanisms that
    underlie resistance in pest insects, including single-site changes in target
    molecules resulting from point mutations and upregulation of degradative
    enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450 enzymes and glutathione
    S-transferases. However several types of resistance found in pest insects,
    such as gene amplification and knock-down resistance, have not been reported
    in Drosophila field populations. Excellent: Drosophila-plant models are
    being studied to understand the adaptation to phytotoxins; P450 enzymes are
    clearly involved in phytotoxin resistance in one of these models. The
    genetic advantages of D. melanogaster, including availability of the
    sequenced genome, should allow further study of these genes and
    identification of new ones, particularly regulatory genes, responsible for
    resistance.

    Eight South American geographical populations of the parasitoid Microctonus

    Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel), a pest of pasture grasses and cereals.
    DNA sequencing (16S, COI, 28S, ITS1, beta-tubulin), RAPD, AFLP,
    microsatellite, SSCP and RFLP analyses were used to seek markers for
    discriminating between the South American populations. All of the South
    American populations were more homogeneous than expected. However, variation
    in microsatellites and 16S gene sequences corroborated morphological,
    allozyme and other phenotypic evidence of trans-Andes variation between the
    populations. The Chilean populations were the most genetically variable,
    while the variation present on the eastern side of the Andes mountains was a
    subset of that observed in Chile.

    Cis-regulatory sequences, such as enhancers and promoters, control
    development and physiology by regulating gene expression. Mutations that
    affect the function of these sequences contribute to phenotypic diversity
    within and between species. With many case studies implicating divergent
    cis-regulatory activity in phenotypic evolution, researchers have recently
    begun to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms that are responsible
    for cis-regulatory divergence. Approaches include detailed functional
    analysis of individual cis-regulatory elements and comparing mechanisms of
    gene regulation among species using the latest genomic tools. Despite the
    limited number of mechanistic studies published to date, this work shows how
    cis-regulatory activity can diverge and how studies of cis-regulatory
    divergence can address long-standing questions about the genetic mechanisms
    of phenotypic evolution.

    BACKGROUND:Changes in developmental gene expression are central to
    phenotypic evolution, but the genetic mechanisms underlying these changes
    are not well understood. Interspecific differences in gene expression can
    arise from evolutionary changes in cis-regulatory DNA and/or in the
    expression of trans-acting regulatory proteins, but few case studies have
    distinguished between these mechanisms. Here, we compare the regulation of
    the yellow gene, which is required for melanization, among distantly related
    Drosophila species with different pigment patterns and determine the
    phenotypic effects of divergent Yellow expression. RESULTS:Yellow expression
    has diverged among D. melanogaster, D. subobscura, and D. virilis and, in
    all cases, correlates with the distribution of black melanin.
    Species-specific Yellow expression patterns were retained in D. melanogaster
    transformants carrying the D. subobscura and D. virilis yellow genes,
    indicating that sequence evolution within the yellow gene underlies the
    divergence of Yellow expression. Evolutionary changes in the activity of
    orthologous cis-regulatory elements are responsible for differences in
    abdominal Yellow expression; however, cis-regulatory element evolution is
    not the sole cause of divergent Yellow expression patterns. Transformation
    of the D. melanogaster yellow gene into D. virilis altered its expression
    pattern, indicating that trans-acting factors that regulate the D.
    melanogaster yellow gene have also diverged between these two species.
    Finally, we found that the phenotypic effects of evolutionary changes in
    Yellow expression depend on epistatic interactions with other genes.
    CONCLUSIONS:Evolutionary changes in Yellow expression correlate with

  abstract: >-
    Body coloration affects how animals interact with the environment. In
    insects, the rapid evolution of black and brown melanin patterns suggests
    that these are adaptive traits. The developmental and molecular mechanisms
    that generate these pigment patterns are largely unknown. We demonstrate
    that the regulation and function of the yellow and ebony genes in Drosophila
    melanogaster play crucial roles in this process. The Yellow protein is
    required to produce black melanin, and is expressed in a pattern that
    correlates with the distribution of this pigment. Conversely, Ebony is
    required to suppress some melanin formation, and is expressed in cells that
    will produce both melanized and non-melanized cuticle. Ectopic expression of
    Ebony inhibits melanin formation, but increasing Yellow expression can
    overcome this effect. In addition, ectopic expression of Yellow is
    sufficient to induce melanin formation, but only in the absence of Ebony.
    These results suggest that the patterns and levels of Yellow and Ebony
    expression together determine the pattern and intensity of melanization.
    Based on their functions in Drosophila melanogaster, we propose that changes
    in the expression of Yellow and/or Ebony may have evolved with melanin
    patterns. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that Yellow and Ebony are
    expressed in complementary spatial patterns that correlate with the
    formation of an evolutionary novel, male-specific pigment pattern in
    Drosophila biarmipes wings. These findings provide a developmental and
    genetic framework for understanding the evolution of melanin patterns.

    The pale-brown chafer, Phyllopertha diversa, utilizes an unusual alkaloid,
    1,3-dimethyl-2,4-(1H,3H)-quinazolinedione as its sex pheromone, This
    compound is rapidly degraded in vitro by the antennal protein extracts from
    this scarab beetle. Demethylation at the N-1 position and hydroxylation of
    the aromatic ring have been identified as the major catabolic pathways, The
    enzyme responsible for the pheromone degradation is membrane-bound, requires
    NAD(P)H for activity and is sensitive to cytochrome P450 inhibitors, such as
    proadifen and metyrapone. The ability to metabolize this unusual pheromone
    was not detected in 12 species tested, indicating that the P450 system,
    specific to male P, diversa antennae, has evolved as a mechanism for
    olfactory signal inactivation. (C) 1999 Federation of European Biochemical

    Neonicotinoid seed dressings have caused concern world-wide. We use large
    field experiments to assess the effects of neonicotinoid-treated crops on
    three bee species across three countries (Hungary, Germany, and the United
    Kingdom). Winter-sown oilseed rape was grown commercially with either seed
    coatings containing neonicotinoids (clothianidin or thiamethoxam) or no seed
    treatment (control). For honey bees, we found both negative (Hungary and
    United Kingdom) and positive (Germany) effects during crop flowering. In
    Hungary, negative effects on honey bees (associated with clothianidin)
    persisted over winter and resulted in smaller colonies in the following
    spring (24% declines). In wild bees (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis),
    reproduction was negatively correlated with neonicotinoid residues. These
    findings point to neonicotinoids causing a reduced capacity of bee species
    to establish new populations in the year following exposure.

    Bee health is affected by neonicotinoids under field-realistic conditions
    across crops conditions.

    Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic
    labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. Previous programs designed for this
    task have been relatively slow and computationally expensive, forcing
    researchers to use faster abundance estimation programs, which only classify
    small subsets of metagenomic data. Using exact alignment of k-mers, Kraken
    achieves classification accuracy comparable to the fastest BLAST program. In
    its fastest mode, Kraken classifies 100 base pair reads at a rate of over
    4.1 million reads per minute, 909 times faster than Megablast and 11 times
    faster than the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn. Kraken is available

    Picoeukaryotes are a taxonomically diverse group of organisms less than 2
    micrometers in diameter. Photosynthetic marine picoeukaryotes in the genus
    Micromonas thrive in ecosystems ranging from tropical to polar and could
    serve as sentinel organisms for biogeochemical fluxes of modern oceans
    during climate change. These broadly distributed primary producers belong to
    an anciently diverged sister clade to land plants. Although Micromonas
    isolates have high 18S ribosomal RNA gene identity, we found that genomes
    from two isolates shared only 90% of their predicted genes. Their
    independent evolutionary paths were emphasized by distinct riboswitch
    arrangements as well as the discovery of intronic repeat elements in one
    isolate, and in metagenomic data, but not in other genomes. Divergence
    appears to have been facilitated by selection and acquisition processes that
    actively shape the repertoire of genes that are mutually exclusive between
    the two isolates differently than the core genes. Analyses of the Micromonas
    genomes offer valuable insights into ecological differentiation and the
    dynamic nature of early plant evolution.

  abstract: >-
    Four main evolutionary lineages of A. mellifera have been described
    including eastern Europe (C) and western and northern Europe (M). Many
    apiculturists prefer bees from the C lineage due to their docility and high
    productivity. In France, the routine importation of bees from the C lineage
    has resulted in the widespread admixture of bees from the M lineage. The
    haplodiploid nature of the honeybee Apis mellifera, and its small genome
    size, permits affordable and extensive genomics studies. As a pilot study of
    a larger project to characterise French honeybee populations, we sequenced
    60 drones sampled from two commercial populations managed for the production
    of honey and royal jelly. Results indicate a C lineage origin, whilst
    mitochondrial analysis suggests two drones originated from the O lineage.
    Analysis of heterozygous SNPs identified potential copy number variants near
    to genes encoding odorant binding proteins and several cytochrome P450
    genes. Signatures of selection were detected using the hapFLK
    haplotype-based method, revealing several regions under putative selection
    for royal jelly production. The framework developed during this study will
    be applied to a broader sampling regime, allowing the genetic diversity of
    French honeybees to be characterised in detail.

    For decades, evolutionary biologists have argued that changes in
    cis-regulatory sequences constitute an important part of the genetic basis
    for adaptation. Although originally based on first principles, this claim is
    now empirically well supported: numerous studies have identified
    cis-regulatory mutations with functionally significant consequences for
    morphology, physiology and behaviour. The focus has now shifted to
    considering whether cis-regulatory and coding mutations make qualitatively
    different contributions to phenotypic evolution. Cases in which parallel
    mutations have produced parallel trait modifications in particular suggest
    that some phenotypic changes are more likely to result from cis-regulatory
    mutations than from coding mutations.

    Background

    Biologists are puzzled by the extremely low percentage (3%) of the binding
    targets of a yeast transcription factor (TF) affected when the TF is knocked
    out, a phenomenon observed by comparing the TF binding dataset and TF
    knockout effect dataset.


    Results

    This study gives a plausible biological explanation of this counterintuitive
    phenomenon. Our analyses find that TFs with high functional redundancy show
    significantly lower percentage than do TFs with low functional redundancy.
    This suggests that functional redundancy may lead to one TF compensating for
    another, thus masking the TF knockout effect on the binding targets of the
    knocked-out TF. In addition, we show that seven classes of genes (lowly
    expressed genes, TATA box-less genes, genes containing a nucleosome-free
    region immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS), genes
    with low transcriptional plasticity, genes with a low number of bound TFs,
    genes with a low number of TFBSs, and genes with a short average distance of
    TFBSs to the TSS) are insensitive to the knockout of their promoter-binding
    TFs, providing clues for finding other biological explanations of the
    surprisingly low percentage of the binding targets of a TF affected when the
    TF is knocked out.


    Conclusions

    This study shows that one property of TFs (functional redundancy) and seven
    properties of genes (expression level, TATA box, nucleosome, transcriptional
    plasticity, the number of bound TFs, the number of TFBSs, and the average
    distance of TFBSs to the TSS) may be useful for explaining a
    counterintuitive phenomenon: most binding targets of a yeast transcription
    factor are not affected when the transcription factor is knocked out.

    Mammalian multidrug-resistant cell lines, selected for resistance to a
    single cytotoxic agent, display cross-resistance to a broad spectrum of
    structurally and functionally unrelated compounds. These cell lines
    overproduce a membrane protein, the P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by a
    member(s) of a multigene family, termed mdr or pgp. The amino acid sequence
    of the P-glycoprotein predicts an energy-dependent transport protein with
    homology to a large superfamily of proteins which transport a wide variety
    of substances. This report describes the isolation and characterization of
    two Drosophila homologs of the mammalian mdr gene. These homologs, located
    in chromosomal sections 49EF and 65A, encode proteins that share over 40%
    amino acid identity to the human and murine mdr P-glycoproteins. Fly strains
    bearing disruptions in the homolog in section 49EF have been constructed and
    implicate this gene in conferring colchicine resistance to the organism.
    This work sets the foundation for the molecular and genetic analysis of mdr
    homologs in Drosophila melanogaster.

    CDC13 encodes a telomere-binding protein that prevents degradation of
    telomeres. cdc 13-1 yeast grown at the nonpermissive temperature undergo
    G2/M arrest, progressive chromosome instability, and subsequent cell death.
    Recently, it has been suggested that cell death in the cdc13-1 mutant is an
    active process characterized by phenotypic hallmarks of apoptosis and
    caspase activation. In this work, we show that cell death triggered by
    cdc13-1 is independent of the yeast metacaspase Yca1p and reactive oxygen
    species but related to cell cycle arrest per se. Inactivating YCA1 or
    depleting reactive oxygen species does not increase viability of cdc13-1
    cells. In turn, caspase activation does not precede cell death in the
    cdc13-1 mutant. Yca1p activity assayed by cell binding of mammalian caspase
    inhibitors is confounded by artifactual labeling of dead yeast cells, which
    nonspecifically bind fluorochromes. We speculate that during a prolonged
    cell cycle arrest, cdc13-1 cells reach a critical size and die by cell
    lysis.

    Transcription factors play essential roles in the developmental processes of
    plants. Many such factors are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). SQUAMOSA
    (SQUA) promoter-binding-like (SPL) genes encode plant-specific transcription
    factors, some of which contain complementary sequences of miRNA156. In this
    study, 19 rice (Oryza sativa) SPL (OsSPL) genes and 12 rice miRNA156
    (OsmiR156) precursors were identified in the rice genome. Sequence and
    experimental analysis suggested that 11 OsSPL genes were putative targets of
    OsmiR156. Plant SPL proteins were classified into six subgroups based on the
    phylogenetic analysis of SQUA promoter-binding protein domain. Diverse
    exon-intron structures and distinct organizations of putative motifs beyond
    the SQUA promoter-binding protein domains were identified in the OsSPL gene
    family. Transcript level analysis of OsSPL genes in various rice tissues and
    organs revealed different tempospatial expression patterns. More than half
    of the OsSPL genes including most OsmiR156-targeted genes are predominantly
    expressed in the young panicles, whereas OsmiR156 genes are predominantly
    expressed in the young shoots and leaves of rice. Overexpression of two
    OsmiR156 genes (OsmiR156b and OsmiR156h) in rice resulted in severe
    dwarfism, strongly reduced panicle size, and delayed flowering, suggesting
    that OsmiR156 and OsSPL target genes are involved in various developmental
    processes, especially the flower development of rice. Different patterns of
    transcript changes (decreased or unchanged) of different target genes in

    Grain yield in rice is a complex trait multiplicatively determined by its
    three component traits: number of panicles, number of grains per panicle,
    and grain weight; all of which are typical quantitative traits. The
    developments in genome mapping, sequencing, and functional genomic research
    have provided powerful tools for investigating the genetic and molecular
    bases of these quantitative traits. Dissection of the genetic bases of the
    yield traits based on molecular marker linkage maps resolved hundreds of
    quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits. Mutant analyses and
    map-based cloning of QTLs have identified a large number of genes required
    for the basic processes underlying the initiation and development of tillers
    and panicles, as well as genes controlling numbers and sizes of grains and
    panicles. Molecular characterization of these genes has greatly advanced the
    mechanistic understanding of the regulation of these rice yield traits.
    These findings have significant implications in crop genetic improvement.

    Yield potential, plant height and heading date are three classes of traits
    that determine the productivity of many crop plants. Here we show that the
    quantitative trait locus (QTL) Ghd7, isolated from an elite rice hybrid and
    encoding a CCT domain protein, has major effects on an array of traits in
    rice, including number of grains per panicle, plant height and heading date.
    Enhanced expression of Ghd7 under long-day conditions delays heading and
    increases plant height and panicle size. Natural mutants with reduced
    function enable rice to be cultivated in temperate and cooler regions. Thus,
    Ghd7 has played crucial roles for increasing productivity and adaptability
    of rice globally.

    Members of the ATP Binding Cassette B/Multidrug-Resistance/P-glyco-protein
    (ABCB/MDR/PGP) subfamily were shown to function primarily in Oryza sativa
    (rice) auxin transport; however, none of the rice ABCB transporters have
    been functionally characterized. Here, we describe that a knock-down of
    OsABCB14 confers decreased auxin concentrations and polar auxin transport
    rates, conferring insensitivity to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)
    and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). OsABCB14 displays enhanced specific auxin
    influx activity in yeast and protoplasts prepared from rice knock-down
    alleles. OsABCB14 is localized at the plasma membrane, pointing to an
    important directionality under physiological conditions. osabcb14 mutants
    were surprisingly found to be insensitive to iron deficiency treatment
    (-Fe). Their Fe concentration is higher and upregulation of Fe
    deficiency-responsive genes is lower in osabcb14 mutants than in wild-type
    rice (Nipponbare, NIP). Taken together, our results strongly support the
    role of OsABCB14 as an auxin influx transporter involved in Fe homeostasis.
    The functional characterization of OsABCB14 provides insights in monocot
    auxin transport and its relationship to Fe nutrition.

    Rice is a staple crop that has undergone substantial phenotypic and
    physiological changes during domestication. Here we resequenced the genomes
    of 40 cultivated accessions selected from the major groups of rice and 10
    accessions of their wild progenitors (Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara) to
    >15 × raw data coverage. We investigated genome-wide variation patterns in
    rice and obtained 6.5 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms
    (SNPs) after excluding sites with missing data in any accession. Using these
    population SNP data, we identified thousands of genes with significantly
    lower diversity in cultivated but not wild rice, which represent candidate
    regions selected during domestication. Some of these variants are associated
    with important biological features, whereas others have yet to be
    functionally characterized. The molecular markers we have identified should
    be valuable for breeding and for identifying agronomically important genes
    in rice.

  abstract: >-
    GH3 proteins control auxin homeostasis by inactivating excess auxin as
    conjugates of amino acids and sugars and thereby controlling cellular
    bioactive auxin. Since auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and
    development, regulated expression of these genes offers a mechanism to
    control various developmental processes. OsMGH3/OsGH3-8 is expressed
    abundantly in rice florets and is regulated by two related and redundant
    transcription factors, OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, but its contribution to flower
    development is not known. We functionally characterize OsMGH3 by
    overexpression and knock-down analysis and show a partial overlap in these
    phenotypes with that of mutants in OsMADS1 and OsMADS6. The overexpression
    of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant
    architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates
    short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of
    OsMADS1 overexpression. In contrast, the down-regulation of endogenous
    OsMGH3 caused phenotypes consistent with auxin overproduction or activated
    signaling, such as ectopic rooting from aerial nodes. Florets in OsMGH3
    knock-down plants were affected in carpel development and pollen viability,
    both of which reduced fertility. Some of these floret phenotypes are similar
    to osmads6 mutants. Taken together, we provide evidence for the functional
    significance of auxin homeostasis and its transcriptional regulation during
    rice panicle branching and floret organ development.

    Functional diversification of duplicated genes can contribute to the
    emergence of new organ morphologies. Model eudicot plants like Arabidopsis
    thaliana and Antirrhinum majus have a single PI/GLO gene that together with
    AP3/DEF regulate petal and stamen formation. Lodicules of grass flowers are
    morphologically distinct reduced organs occupying the position of petals in
    other flowers. They serve a distinct function in partial and transient
    flower opening to allow stamen emergence and cross-pollination. Grasses have
    duplicated PI/GLO-like genes and in rice (Oryza sativa) one these genes,
    OsMADS2, controls lodicule formation without affecting stamen development.
    In this study, we investigate the mechanistic roles played by OsMADS2. We
    ascribe a function for OsMADS2 in controlling cell division and
    differentiation along the proximal-distal axis. OsMADS2 is required to
    trigger parenchymatous and lodicule-specific vascular development while
    maintaining a small organ size. Our data implicate the developmentally late
    spatially restricted accumulation of OsMADS2 transcripts in the
    differentiating lodicule to control growth of these regions. The global
    architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the
    regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can
    form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret
    opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4.

    The C-class MADS box gene AGAMOUS (AG) plays crucial roles in Arabidopsis
    thaliana development by regulating the organ identity of stamens and
    carpels, the repression of A-class genes, and floral meristem determinacy.
    To examine the conservation and diversification of C-class gene function in
    monocots, we analyzed two C-class genes in rice (Oryza sativa), OSMADS3 and
    OSMADS58, which may have arisen by gene duplication before divergence of
    rice and maize (Zea mays). A knockout line of OSMADS3, in which the gene is
    disrupted by T-DNA insertion, shows homeotic transformation of stamens into
    lodicules and ectopic development of lodicules in the second whorl near the
    palea where lodicules do not form in the wild type but carpels develop
    almost normally. By contrast, RNA-silenced lines of OSMADS58 develop
    astonishing flowers that reiterate a set of floral organs, including
    lodicules, stamens, and carpel-like organs, suggesting that determinacy of
    the floral meristem is severely affected. These results suggest that the two
    C-class genes have been partially subfunctionalized during rice evolution
    (i.e., the functions regulated by AG have been partially partitioned into
    two paralogous genes, OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which were produced by a recent
    gene duplication event in plant evolution).

    Summary

    Ants exhibit cooperative behaviors and advanced forms of sociality that
    depend on pheromone-mediated communication. Odorant receptor neurons (ORNs)
    express specific odorant receptors (ORs) encoded by a dramatically expanded
    gene family in ants. In most eusocial insects, only the queen can transmit
    genetic information, restricting genetic studies. In contrast, workers in
    Harpegnathos saltator ants can be converted into gamergates (pseudoqueens)
    that can found entire colonies. This feature facilitated CRISPR-Cas9
    generation of germline mutations in orco, the gene that encodes the obligate
    co-receptor of all ORs. orco mutations should significantly impact
    olfaction. We demonstrate striking functions of Orco in odorant perception,
    reproductive physiology, and social behavior plasticity. Surprisingly,
    unlike in other insects, loss of OR functionality also dramatically impairs
    development of the antennal lobe to which ORNs project. Therefore, the
    development of genetics in Harpegnathos establishes this ant species as a
    model organism to study the complexity of eusociality.

    Insecticide resistance is a major problem for both medicine and agriculture
    and is frequently associated with overexpression of metabolic enzymes that
    catalyze the breakdown of pesticides, leading to broad-spectrum resistance.
    However, the insect tissues within which these metabolic enzymes normally
    reside remain unclear. Microarray analysis of nine adult tissues from
    Drosophila melanogaster reveals that cytochrome P-450s and
    glutathione-S-transferases show highly tissue-specific expression patterns;
    most were confined to one or more epithelial tissues, and half showed
    dominant expression in a single tissue. The particular detoxifying enzymes
    encountered by a xenobiotic thus depend critically on the route of
    administration. In particular, known insecticide metabolism genes are highly
    enriched in insect Malpighian (renal) tubules, implicating them in
    xenobiotic metabolism. The tubules thus display, with the fat body, roles
    analogous to the vertebrate liver and immune system, as well as its
    acknowledged renal function. To illustrate this, when levels of a single
    gene, Cyp6g1, were manipulated in just the Malpighian tubules of adult
    Drosophila, the survival of the whole insect after
    1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) challenge was altered,
    whereas corresponding manipulations in the nervous system or the fat body
    were without effect. This shows that, although detoxification enzymes are
    widely distributed, baseline protection against DDT resides primarily in the
    insect excretory system, corresponding to less than 0.1% of the mass of the
    organism.

    Insertions and deletions (indels) are a major class of genomic variation
    associated with human disease. Indels are primarily detected from DNA
    sequencing (DNA-seq) data but their transcriptional consequences remain
    unexplored due to challenges in discriminating medium-sized and large indels
    from splicing events in RNA-seq data.

    Five contemporary strains of the bollworm Helicoverpa armigera Hubner from
    China, Pakistan and India, all with high resistance to pyrethroids.. were
    compared with a standard susceptible strain that originated from the Cote
    D'Ivoire in the 1970s ('SCD'). Two of the Chinese strains ('YGF' and 'YGFP')
    were derived by laboratory selection from a third, field collected strain
    ('YG'). The strain 'YG' exhibited 7-, 14- and 21-fold resistance to
    fenvalerate, cypermethrin and deltamethrin, respectively. After selection
    with fenvalerate for 14 generations ('YGF'), this increased to 1690-, 540-
    and 73-fold. Selection with a mixture of fenvalerate and piperonyl butoxide
    (PBO) for 14 generations ('YGFP') resulted in resistance ratios of 2510,
    2920 and 286. The synergistic ratios to fenvalerate that resulted from
    pre-treatment of PBO were 5-, 462- and 12-fold in YG, YGF and YGFP strains,
    respectively. Resistance ratios for a Pakistani strain (PAK) were 2320-,
    4100- and 223-fold to fenvalerate, cypermethrin and deltamethrin,
    respectively. The synergistic ratio of PBO to these pyrethroids was 450-,
    950- and 11-fold. The strong synergism of pyrethroids by PBO implied that an
    oxidative metabolism could be involved in pyrethroid resistance in these
    resistant strains. The activities of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases from
    midguts of final instar larvae to p-nitroanisole (PNOD), ethoxycoumarin
    (ECOD), methoxyresorufin (MROD) significantly increased in all the resistant
    strains when compared with the susceptible strain. This further implies that
    cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are involved in pyrethroid resistance in
    Asian H. armigera. Comparative in vitro studies of the metabolism of
    C-14-deltamethrin by midgut microsomes of the resistant PAK and susceptible
    SCD strains showed that the resistant strain had a much greater capacity
    than the susceptible strain for the metabolic degradation of deltamethrin.
    This enhanced metabolic degradation occurred in the presence of NADPH which
    suggested an oxidative detoxification. In the resistant strains, minor
    increases in glutathione S-transferase activity (to the substrates CDNB and
    DCNB), and esterase activity (to the substrate alpha-naphthyl acetate)
    further suggested that, of the putative metabolic mechanisms, oxidases are
    the most important. This study provides the first evidence that cytochrome
    P450 monooxygenases are a major metabolic mechanism responsible for
    pyrethroid resistance in H. armigera from Asia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

    To study the function of specific cells or tissues using genomic tools like
    microarray analyses, it is highly desirable to obtain mRNA from a
    homogeneous source. However, this is particularly challenging for small
    organisms, like Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We have
    optimized and applied a new technique, mRNA tagging, to isolate mRNA from
    specific tissues of D.melanogaster. A FLAG-tagged poly(A)-binding protein
    (PABP) is expressed in a specific tissue and mRNA from that tissue is thus
    tagged by the recombinant PABP and separated from mRNA in other tissues by
    co-immunoprecipitation with a FLAG-tag specific antibody. The fractionated
    mRNA is then amplified and used as probe in microarray experiments. As a
    test system, we employed the procedures to identify genes expressed in
    Drosophila photoreceptor cells. We found that most known photoreceptor
    cell-specific mRNAs were identified by mRNA tagging. Furthermore, at least
    11 novel genes have been identified as enriched in photoreceptor cells. mRNA
    tagging is a powerful general method for profiling gene expression in
    specific tissues and for identifying tissue-specific genes.

    The sweet potato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)
    (Hemiptera:Aleyrodidae), is an invasive and damaging pest of field crops
    worldwide. The neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid has been widely used
    to control this pest. We assessed the species composition (B vs. Q),
    imidacloprid resistance, and association between imidacloprid resistance and
    the expression of five P450 genes for 14–17 B. tabaci populations in 12
    provinces in China. Fifteen of 17 populations contained only B. tabaci Q,
    and two populations contained both B and Q. Seven of 17 populations
    exhibited moderate to high resistance to imidacloprid, and eight populations
    exhibited low resistance to imidacloprid, compared with the most susceptible
    field WHHB population. In a study of 14 of the populations, resistance level
    was correlated with the expression of the P450 genes CYP6CM1 and CYP4C64 but
    not with the expression of CYP6CX1, CYP6CX4, or CYP6DZ7. This study
    indicates that B. tabaci Q has a wider distribution in China than previously
    reported. Resistance to imidacloprid in field populations of B. tabaci is
    associated with the increased expression of two cytochrome P450 genes
    (CYP6CM1 and CYP4C64).

    Rice yield and heading date are two distinct traits controlled by
    quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The dissection of molecular mechanisms
    underlying rice yield traits is important for developing high-yielding rice
    varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Ghd8, a major
    QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date, and plant height.
    Two sets of near isogenic line populations were developed for the cloning of
    Ghd8. Ghd8 was narrowed down to a 20-kb region containing two putative
    genes, of which one encodes the OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT-box binding
    protein (HAP complex); this gene was regarded as the Ghd8 candidate. A
    complementary test confirmed the identity and pleiotropic effects of the
    gene; interestingly, the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on its genetic
    background. By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under
    long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions. Ghd8
    up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this
    increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus
    producing 50% more grains per plant. The ectopic expression of Ghd8 in
    Arabidopsis caused early flowering by 10 d-a situation similar to the one
    observed by its homolog AtHAP3b, when compared to wild-type under long-day
    conditions; these findings indicate the conserved function of Ghd8 and
    AtHAP3b in flowering in Arabidopsis. Our results demonstrated the important
    roles of Ghd8 in rice yield formation and flowering, as well as its opposite
    functions in flowering between rice and Arabidopsis under long-day
    conditions.

    A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling response to photoperiod,
    Hd1, was identified by means of a map-based cloning strategy.
    High-resolution mapping using 1505 segregants enabled us to define a genomic
    region of approximately 12 kb as a candidate for Hd1. Further analysis
    revealed that the Hd1 QTL corresponds to a gene that is a homolog of
    CONSTANS in Arabidopsis. Sequencing analysis revealed a 43-bp deletion in
    the first exon of the photoperiod sensitivity 1 (se1) mutant HS66 and a
    433-bp insertion in the intron in mutant HS110. Se1 is allelic to the Hd1
    QTL, as determined by analysis of two se1 mutants, HS66 and HS110. Genetic
    complementation analysis proved the function of the candidate gene. The
    amount of Hd1 mRNA was not greatly affected by a change in length of the
    photoperiod. We suggest that Hd1 functions in the promotion of heading under
    short-day conditions and in inhibition under long-day conditions.

    Two homologs of PISTILLATA have been identified in rice: OsMADS2 and
    OsMADS4. However, their roles in floral organ development are controversial.
    Here, we demonstrate that the genes show unequal redundancy of class B
    function. Although OsMADS2 plays an important role in lodicule development,
    OsMADS4 also supports the specification of lodicule identity. In contrast,
    the genes are roughly equally important in stamen development. Consistent
    with their redundant functions, both OsMADS2 and OsMADS4 interact with the
    unique rice AP3 ortholog SPW1.

    Molecular approaches are increasingly being used to analyse host-parasitoid
    food webs as they overcome several hurdles inherent to conventional
    approaches. However, such studies have focused primarily on the detection
    and identification of aphids and their aphidiid primary parasitoids, largely
    ignoring primary parasitoid-hyperparasitoid interactions or limiting these
    to a few common species within a small geographical area. Furthermore, the
    detection of bacterial secondary endosymbionts has not been considered in
    such assays despite the fact that endosymbionts may alter aphid-parasitoid
    interactions, as they can confer protection against parasitoids. Here we
    present a novel two-step multiplex PCR (MP-PCR) protocol to assess cereal
    aphid-primary parasitoid-hyperparasitoid-endosymbiont interactions. The
    first step of the assay allows detection of parasitoid DNA at a general
    level (24 primary and 16 hyperparasitoid species) as well as the
    species-specific detection of endosymbionts (3 species) and cereal aphids (3
    species). The second step of the MP-PCR assay targets seven primary and six
    hyperparasitoid species that commonly occur in Central Europe. Additional
    parasitoid species not covered by the second-step of the assay can be
    identified via sequencing 16S rRNA amplicons generated in the first step of
    the assay. The approach presented here provides an efficient, highly
    sensitive, and cost-effective (~consumable costs of 1.3 € per sample) tool
    for assessing cereal aphid-parasitoid-endosymbiont interactions.

    All organisms are confronted with external variations in trace element
    abundance. To elucidate the mechanisms that maintain metal homeostasis and
    protect against heavy metal stress, we have determined the transcriptome
    responses in Drosophila to sublethal doses of cadmium, zinc, copper, as well
    as to copper depletion. Furthermore, we analyzed the transcriptome of a
    metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF-1) null mutant. The gene family
    encoding metallothioneins, and the ABC transporter CG10505 that encodes a
    homolog of 'yeast cadmium factor' were induced by all three metals. Zinc and
    cadmium responses have similar features: genes upregulated by both metals
    include those for glutathione S-transferases GstD2 and GstD5, and for zinc
    transporter-like proteins designated ZnT35C and ZnT63C. Several of the
    metal-induced genes that emerged in our study are regulated by the
    transcription factor MTF-1. mRNA studies in MTF-1 overexpressing or null
    mutant flies and in silico search for metal response elements (binding sites
    for MTF-1) confirmed novel MTF-1 regulated genes such as ferritins, the ABC
    transporter CG10505 and the zinc transporter ZnT35C. The latter was analyzed
    in most detail; biochemical and genetic approaches, including targeted
    mutation, indicate that ZnT35C is involved in cellular and organismal zinc
    efflux and plays a major role in zinc detoxification.

    for gene regulatory studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Three
    interlinked databases, AtTFDB, AtcisDB and AtRegNet, furnish comprehensive
    and updated information on transcription factors (TFs), predicted and
    experimentally verified cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and their
    interactions, respectively. In addition to significant contributions in the
    identification of the entire set of TF-DNA interactions, which are the key
    to understand the gene regulatory networks that govern Arabidopsis gene
    expression, tools recently incorporated into AGRIS include the complete set
    of words length 5-15 present in the Arabidopsis genome and the integration
    of AtRegNet with visualization tools, such as the recently developed ReIN
    application. All the information in AGRIS is publicly available and

    We introduce ggbio, a new methodology to visualize and explore genomics
    annotationsand high-throughput data. The plots provide detailed views of
    genomic regions,summary views of sequence alignments and splicing patterns,
    and genome-wide overviewswith karyogram, circular and grand linear layouts.
    The methods leverage thestatistical functionality available in R, the
    grammar of graphics and the datahandling capabilities of the Bioconductor
    project. The plots are specified within amodular framework that enables
    users to construct plots in a systematic way, and aregenerated directly from
    Bioconductor data structures. The ggbio R package isavailable

    Post-embryonic development depends on the activity of meristems in plants,
    and thus control of cell fate in the meristem is crucial to plant
    development and its architecture. In grasses such as rice and maize, the
    fate of reproductive meristems changes from indeterminate meristems, such as
    inflorescence and branch meristems, to determinate meristems, such as the
    spikelet meristem. Here we analyzed a recessive mutant of rice, aberrant
    spikelet and panicle1 (asp1), that showed pleiotropic phenotypes such as a
    disorganized branching pattern, aberrant spikelet morphology, and
    disarrangement of phyllotaxy. Close examination revealed that regulation of
    meristem fate was compromised in asp1: degeneration of the inflorescence
    meristem was delayed, transition from the branch meristem to the spikelet
    meristem was accelerated, and stem cell maintenance in both the branch
    meristem and the spikelet meristem was compromised. The genetic program was
    also disturbed in terms of spikelet development. Gene isolation revealed
    that ASP1 encodes a transcriptional co-repressor that is related to TOPLESS
    (TPL) in Arabidopsis and RAMOSA ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2) in maize. It is
    likely that the pleiotropic defects are associated with de-repression of
    multiple genes related to meristem function in the asp1 mutant. The asp1
    mutant also showed de-repression of axillary bud growth and disturbed
    phyllotaxy in the vegetative phase, suggesting that the function of this
    gene is closely associated with auxin action. Consistent with these
    observations and the molecular function of Arabidopsis TPL, auxin signaling
    was also compromised in the rice asp1 mutant. Taken together, these results
    indicate that ASP1 regulates various aspects of developmental processes and
    physiological responses as a transcriptional co-repressor in rice.

  abstract: >-
    The flower of rice diverged from those of model eudicot species such as
    Arabidopsis, Antirrhinum, or Petunia, and is thus of great interest in
    developmental and evolutionary biology. Specific to grass species, including
    rice, are the structural units of the inflorescence called the spikelet and
    floret, which comprise grass-specific peripheral organs and conserved sexual
    organs. Recent advances in molecular genetic studies have provided an
    understanding of the functions of rapidly increasing numbers of genes
    involved in rice flower development. The genetic framework of rice flower
    development is in part similar to that of model eudicots. However, rice also
    probably recruits specific genetic mechanisms, which probably contribute to
    the establishment of the specific floral architecture of rice. In this
    review, the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice flowering are outlined,
    focusing on recent information and in comparison with those of model
    eudicots.

  abstract: >-
    Inflorescence structures result from the activities of meristems, which
    coordinate both the renewal of stem cells in the center and organ formation
    at the periphery. The fate of a meristem is specified at its initiation and
    changes as the plant develops. During rice inflorescence development, newly
    formed meristems acquire a branch meristem (BM) identity, and can generate
    further meristems or terminate as spikelets. Thus, the form of rice
    inflorescence is determined by a reiterative pattern of decisions made at
    the meristems. In the dominant gain-of-function mutant tawawa1-D, the
    activity of the inflorescence meristem (IM) is extended and spikelet
    specification is delayed, resulting in prolonged branch formation and
    increased numbers of spikelets. In contrast, reductions in TAWAWA1 (TAW1)
    activity cause precocious IM abortion and spikelet formation, resulting in
    the generation of small inflorescences. TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of
    unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical
    meristem, the IM, and the BMs. TAW1 expression disappears from incipient
    spikelet meristems (SMs). We also demonstrate that members of the SHORT
    VEGETATIVE PHASE subfamily of MADS-box genes function downstream of TAW1. We
    thus propose that TAW1 is a unique regulator of meristem activity in rice
    and regulates inflorescence development through the promotion of IM activity
    and suppression of the phase change to SM identity.

  abstract: >-
    Steroid hormones mediate a wide variety of developmental and physiological
    events in multicellular organisms. During larval and pupal stages of
    insects, the principal steroid hormone is ecdysone, which is synthesized in
    the prothoracic gland (PG) and plays a central role in the control of
    development. Although many studies have revealed the biochemical features of
    ecdysone synthesis in the PG, many aspects of this pathway have remained
    unclear at the molecular level. We describe the neverland (nvd) gene, which
    encodes an oxygenase-like protein with a Rieske electron carrier domain,
    from the silkworm Bombyx mori and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. nvd
    is expressed specifically in tissues that synthesize ecdysone, such as the
    PG. We also show that loss of nvd function in the PG causes arrest of both
    molting and growth during Drosophila development. Furthermore, the phenotype
    is rescued by application of 20-hydroxyecdysone or the precursor
    7-dehydrocholesterol. Given that the nvd family is evolutionally conserved,
    these results suggest that Nvd is an essential regulator of cholesterol
    metabolism or trafficking in steroid synthesis across animal phyla.

    standard methods give biased results on RNA-seq data due to over-detection
    of differential expression for long and highly expressed transcripts.
    Application of GOseq to a prostate cancer data set shows that GOseq

  abstract: >-
    Rice (Oryza sativa) has unique floral patterns that contribute to grain
    yield. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the specification of
    floral organ identities in rice, particularly the interaction among floral
    homeotic genes, remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the floral
    homeotic gene OsMADS16 (also called SUPERWOMAN1, SPW1, a B-class gene) acts
    together with the rice C-class genes OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 in specifying
    floral organ patterning. OsMADS16 and the two C-class genes have an
    overlapping expression pattern in the third whorl founder cells. Compared
    with the single mutants, both spw1-1 osmads3-4 and spw1-1 osmads58 double
    mutants exhibit additional whorls of glume-like organs within the flower,
    particularly an extra whorl of six glume-like structures formed at the
    position of the wild-type stamens. These ectopic glume-like structures were
    shown to have palea identity through cellular observation and in situ
    hybridization analysis using marker genes. Our results suggest that B- and
    C-class genes play a key role in suppressing indeterminate growth within the
    floral meristem, particularly whorl-3 primordia. We also hypothesize that,
    in contrast to previous assumptions, the specialized spikelet organ in rice,
    the palea, is the counterpart of the sepal in eudicots, and the lemma is
    homologous to the bract.

  abstract: >-
    According to the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution, selection
    intensity in interactions varies across a landscape, forming a selection
    mosaic; interaction traits match at coevolutionary hotspots where selection
    is reciprocal and mismatch at coldspots where reciprocity is not a factor.
    Chemical traits play an important role in the interaction between wild
    parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) and the parsnip webworm (Depressaria
    pastinacella). Furanocoumarins, produced as plant defenses, are detoxified
    by the webworms by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases; significant additive
    genetic variation exists for both furanocoumarin production in the plant and
    detoxification in the insect, making these traits available for selection.
    To test the hypothesis that differences in selection intensity affect the
    distribution of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots in this interaction,
    we examined 20 populations of webworms and wild parsnips in Illinois and
    Wisconsin that varied in size, extent of infestation, proximity to woods
    (and potential vertebrate predators), and proximity to a chemically distinct
    alternate host plant, Heracleum lanatum (cow parsnip). Twelve of 20
    populations displayed phenotype matching between plant defense and insect
    detoxification profiles. Of the eight mismatched populations, a logistic
    regression model related matching probability to two predictors: the
    presence of the alternate host and average content of xanthotoxin (one of
    the five furanocoumarins produced by P. sativa). The odds of mismatching
    were significantly increased by the presence of the alternate host (odds
    ratio = 15.4) and by increased xanthotoxin content (odds ratio = 6.053).
    Parsnips growing near cow parsnip displayed chemical phenotypes that were
    chemically intermediate between cow parsnip and parsnips growing in
    isolation. Rapid phenotype matching in this system is likely due in part to
    differential mortality every season; larvae transferred to a plant 30 m or
    more from the plant on which they developed tended to experience increased
    mortality over larvae transferred to another umbel on the same plant on
    which they had developed, and plant populations that mismatched in 2001
    displayed a change in chemical phenotype distribution from the previous
    year. Trait mixing through gene flow is also a likely factor in determining
    mismatch frequency. Populations from which webworms were eradicated the
    previous year were all recolonized; in three of seven of these populations,
    infestation rates exceeded 90%. Our findings, consistent with the geographic
    mosaic theory, suggest that the presence of a chemically distinct alternate
    host plant can affect selection intensity in such a way as to reduce the
    likelihood of reciprocity in the coevolutionary interaction between wild
    parsnip and the parsnip webworm.

    As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more
    widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has
    dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is
    becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better
    facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the
    scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis
    tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information
    on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the
    analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights
    into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data.
    We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis,
    particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the
    scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with
    most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being
    extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database
    provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis
    and records the growth of the field over time.

    We have used maximum-likelihood models of codon substitution to investigate
    the role of adaptive evolution in the evolution of cytochrome P450 (CYP)
    sequences. Evidence for the operation of adaptive evolution in the evolution
    of rat CYP2C, rabbit CYP2C, rat CYP2D, human CYP3A and rabbit CYP4A was
    observed. The absence of signal in rat CYP2B, rat CYP3A, human CYP2C and
    monkey CYP2C suggests that the adaptive evolution did not operate in the
    evolution of these cytochromes. Our results show identical adaptive
    evolution patterns for rabbit (lagomorpha) and rat (rodentia) CYP2C. The
    absence of signal for adaptive evolution in primate CYP2C suggests that the
    identical rat and rabbit CYP2C patterns arose in the last common ancestor of
    rodentia and lagomorpha.Furthermore, we have found statistically significant
    association of sites under adaptive evolution and Gotoh's substrate
    recognition sites in rat and rabbit CYP2C (5%), human CYP3A and rat CYP2D
    (10%). From these correlations, the given substrate-dependent nature of
    differences in CYP substrate-specificity profiles and differences in
    cytochrome active-site residues, we hypothesize that the most likely role of
    adaptive evolution in the evolution of cytochrome P450 substrate
    specificities was to fix mutations that permitted an increased number of
    binding modes (thereby expanding the substrate repertoire). The pattern of
    adaptive evolution observed in this work is consistent with results from
    microsomal studies in which CYP2C isoforms are responsible for most of the
    metabolism of foreign compounds in rat and rabbit, and CYP3A isoforms play
    the same role in humans.

  abstract: >-
    Polyphagous herbivores encounter allelochemicals as complex mixtures in
    their host plants, and the toxicity of an individual compound may be
    influenced by the chemical matrix in which it is encountered. Certain plant
    constituents may reduce toxicity of cooccurring compounds by inducing
    detoxification systems, including cytochrome P450s, which can metabolize a
    broad range of substances. The polyphagous corn earworm Helicoverpa zea
    encounters a diversity of plant allelochemicals in its many host plants and,
    as well, can encounter aflatoxins, mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus
    and Aspergillus parasiticus that infect damaged grains. Dietary
    supplementation of each of three plant allelochemicals that are frequently
    (coumarin, COU), occasionally (indole-3-carbinol, 13C), or rarely
    (xanthotoxin, XAN) encountered by H. zea larvae substantially reduced the
    toxicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) to H. zea. Compared to fourth instars on
    diets containing 1 microg/g AFB1 that failed to develop and pupate, fourth
    instars on diets containing I3C and XAN increased in mass by 216.1 and 700%
    after 6 days, and pupated at rates of 40 and 88%, respectively. Diets
    containing COU or XAN also significantly reduced the mortality rates of
    caterpillars exposed to the insecticides, diazinon and carbaryl. Diets
    containing COU and XAN increased CYP6B8 transcripts 2.6-fold; CYP321A1
    transcripts increased 20.7, 8.3, and 10.6-fold in response to COU, I3C, and
    XAN, respectively. These results indicate that consumption of plant
    allelochemicals can ameliorate toxicity of natural and synthetic toxins
    encountered by insects, and they suggest that P450s induced by these
    allelochemicals contribute to detoxification of these chemicals in H. zea.

    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small noncoding RNAs, derived by
    processing of short RNA hairpins, that can inhibit the translation of mRNAs
    bearing partially complementary target sequences. In contrast, small
    interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are derived by processing of long
    double-stranded RNAs and are often of exogenous origin, degrade mRNAs
    bearing fully complementary sequences. Here, we demonstrate that an
    endogenously encoded human miRNA is able to cleave an mRNA bearing fully
    complementary target sites, whereas an exogenously supplied siRNA can
    inhibit the expression of an mRNA bearing partially complementary sequences
    without inducing detectable RNA cleavage. These data suggest that miRNAs and
    siRNAs can use similar mechanisms to repress mRNA expression and that the
    choice of mechanism may be largely or entirely determined by the degree of
    complementary of the RNA target.

    Enclonuclease G (EndoG) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein reported
    to be important for both nuclear DNA fragmentation during apoptosis and
    mitochondrial DNA replication. To evaluate the in vivo function of EndoG, we
    have investigated the effects of EndoG deficiency in cells and mice. We
    found that EndoG homozygous mutant embryos die between embryonic days 2.5
    and 3.5. Mitochondrial DNA copy numbers in ovulated oocytes from EndoG
    heterozygous mutant and wild-type mice are similar, suggesting that EndoG is
    involved in a cellular function unrelated to mitochondrial DNA replication.
    Interestingly, we found that cells from EndoG heterozygous mutant mice
    exhibit increased resistance to both tumor necrosis factor alpha- and
    staurosporine-induced cell death. Moreover, spontaneous cell death of
    spermatogonia in EndoG heterozygous mutant mice is significantly reduced
    compared with wild-type mice. DNA fragmentation is also reduced in
    EndoG(+/-) thymocytes and splenocytes compared with wild-type cells, as well
    as in EndoG+/- thymus in vivo compared with that of the wild-type mice, on
    activation of apoptosis. These findings indicate that EndoG is essential
    during early embryogenesis and plays a critical role in normal apoptosis and
    nuclear DNA fragmentation.

    WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) genes form a large gene family specifically
    expressed in plants. They are known to play important roles in regulating
    the development of plant tissues and organs by determining cell fate. Recent
    available whole genome sequences allow us to do more comprehensive
    phylogenetic analysis of the WOX genes in plants. In the present study, we
    identified 11 and 21 WOXs from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea
    mays), respectively. The 72 WOX genes from rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum,
    maize, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa)
    were grouped into three well supported clades with nine subgroups according
    to the amino acid sequences of their homodomains. Their phylogenetic
    relationship was also supported by the observation of the motifs outside the
    homodomain. We observed the variation of duplication events among the nine
    sub-groups between monocots and eudicots, for instance, more gene
    duplication events of WOXs within subgroup A for monocots, while, less for
    dicots in this subgroup. Furthermore, we observed the conserved intron/exon
    structural patterns of WOX genes in rice, sorghum and Arabidopsis. In
    addition, WUS (Wuschel)-box and EAR (the ERF-associated amphiphilic
    repression)-like motif were observed to be conserved among several WOX
    subgroups in these five plants. Comparative analysis of expression patterns
    of WOX genes in rice and Arabidopsis suggest that the WOX genes play
    conserved and various roles in plants. This work provides insights into the
    evolution of the WOX gene family and is useful for future research.

    BACKGROUND:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a wide
    range of biological processes in mammals and plants. However, the systematic
    examination of lncRNAs in plants lags behind that in mammals. Recently,
    lncRNAs have been identified in Arabidopsis and wheat; however, no
    systematic screening of potential lncRNAs has been reported for the rice
    genome. RESULTS:In this study, we perform whole transcriptome
    strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) of samples from rice anthers,
    pistils, and seeds 5 days after pollination and from shoots 14 days after
    germination. Using these data, together with 40 available rice RNA-seq
    datasets, we systematically analyze rice lncRNAs and definitively identify
    lncRNAs that are involved in the reproductive process. The results show that
    rice lncRNAs have some different characteristics compared to those of
    Arabidopsis and mammals and are expressed in a highly tissue-specific or
    stage-specific manner. We further verify the functions of a set of lncRNAs
    that are preferentially expressed in reproductive stages and identify
    several lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which sequester
    miR160 or miR164 in a type of target mimicry. More importantly, one lncRNA,
    XLOC_057324, is demonstrated to play a role in panicle development and
    fertility. We also develop a source of rice lncRNA-associated insertional
    mutants. CONCLUSIONS:Genome-wide screening and functional analysis enabled
    the identification of a set of lncRNAs that are involved in the sexual
    reproduction of rice. The results also provide a source of lncRNAs and
    associated insertional mutants in rice.

    Gene expression is controlled by the complex interaction of transcription
    factors binding to promoters and other regulatory DNA elements. One common
    characteristic of the genomic regions associated with regulatory proteins is
    a pronounced sensitivity to DNase I digestion. We generated genome-wide
    high-resolution maps of DNase I hypersensitive (DH) sites from both seedling
    and callus tissues of rice (Oryza sativa). Approximately 25% of the DH sites
    from both tissues were found in putative promoters, indicating that the vast
    majority of the gene regulatory elements in rice are not located in promoter
    regions. We found 58% more DH sites in the callus than in the seedling. For
    DH sites detected in both the seedling and callus, 31% displayed
    significantly different levels of DNase I sensitivity within the two
    tissues. Genes that are differentially expressed in the seedling and callus
    were frequently associated with DH sites in both tissues. The DNA sequences
    contained within the DH sites were hypomethylated, consistent with what is
    known about active gene regulatory elements. Interestingly, tissue-specific
    DH sites located in the promoters showed a higher level of DNA methylation
    than the average DNA methylation level of all the DH sites located in the
    promoters. A distinct elevation of H3K27me3 was associated with intergenic
    DH sites. These results suggest that epigenetic modifications play a role in
    the dynamic changes of the numbers and DNase I sensitivity of DH sites
    during development.

    The grass family is one of the largest families in angiosperms and has
    evolved a characteristic inflorescence morphology, with complex branches and
    specialized spikelets. The origin and development of the highly divergent
    inflorescence architecture in grasses have recently received much attention.
    Increasing evidence has revealed that numerous factors, such as
    transcription factors and plant hormones, play key roles in determining
    reproductive meristem fate and inflorescence patterning in grasses.
    Moreover, some molecular switches that have been implicated in specifying
    inflorescence shapes contribute significantly to grain yields in cereals.
    Here, we review key genetic and molecular switches recently identified from
    two model grass species, rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays), that
    regulate inflorescence morphology specification, including meristem
    identity, meristem size and maintenance, initiation and outgrowth of
    axillary meristems, and organogenesis. Furthermore, we summarize emerging
    networks of genes and pathways in grass inflorescence morphogenesis and
    emphasize their evolutionary divergence in comparison with the model eudicot
    Arabidopsis thaliana. We also discuss the agricultural application of genes
    controlling grass inflorescence development.

    We cloned a cDNA for a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of mammalian heme
    oxygenase (HO) and constructed a bacterial expression system of a truncated,
    soluble form of D. melanogaster HO (DmDeltaHO). The purified DmDeltaHO
    degraded hemin to biliverdin, CO and iron in the presence of reducing
    systems such as NADPH/cytochrome P450 reductase and sodium ascorbate,
    although the reaction rate was slower than that of mammalian HOs. Some
    properties of DmHO, however, are quite different from other known HOs. Thus
    DmDeltaHO bound hemin stoichiometrically to form a hemin-enzyme complex like
    other HOs, but this complex did not show an absorption spectrum of
    hexa-coordinated heme protein. The absorption spectrum of the ferric complex
    was not influenced by changing the pH of the solution. Interestingly, an EPR
    study revealed that the iron of heme was not involved in binding heme to the
    enzyme. Hydrogen peroxide failed to convert it into verdoheme. A spectrum of
    the ferrous-CO form of verdoheme was not detected during the reaction from
    hemin under oxygen and CO. Degradation of hemin catalyzed by DmDeltaHO
    yielded three isomers of biliverdin, of which biliverdin IXalpha and two
    other isomers (IXbeta and IXdelta) accounted for 75% and 25%, respectively.
    Taken together, we conclude that, although DmHO acts as a real HO in D.
    melanogaster, its active-site structure is quite different from those of
    other known HOs.

    Levels of cytochrome P450 and be were investigated in microsomal enzymes of
    houseflies from the gut and fat body of the third instar larvae of a
    pyriproxyfen-resistant strain (YPPF) and two pyriproxyfen-susceptible
    strains (YS and SRS). In comparison to the YS and SRS strains, YPPF
    microsomes had higher levels of total cytochrome P450s in both the gut and
    fat body. Furthermore, microsomes from the gut and fat body of YPPF larvae
    were found to have a much greater ability to hydroxylate aniline than YS
    larvae. In vitro metabolism studies of pyriproxyfen indicated that the
    metabolic rates were much higher in both the gut and fat body of YPPF larvae
    than of YS and SRS larvae. The major metabolites of pyriproxyfen in
    houseflies were identified to be 4'-OH-pyriproxyfen and 5”-OH-pyriproxyfen.
    Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, piperonyl butoxide (PB) and 2-propynyl
    2,3,6-trichlorophenyl ether (PTPE), decreased the metabolic rates
    significantly in all three strains. This study confirmed that microsomal
    cytochrome P450 monooxygenases play an important role in the pyriproxyfen
    resistance of the housefly. Furthermore, it suggests that the fat body must
    be as important as the gut for the metabolism of pyriproxyfen in resistant
    housefly larvae. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

  abstract: >-
    Albaflavenone synthase (CYP170A1) is a monooxygenase catalyzing the final
    two steps in the biosynthesis of this antibiotic in the soil bacterium,
    Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Interestingly, CYP170A1 shows no stereo
    selection forming equal amounts of two albaflavenol epimers, each of which
    is oxidized in turn to albaflavenone. To explore the structural basis of the
    reaction mechanism, we have studied the crystal structures of both
    ligand-free CYP170A1 (2.6 angstrom) and complex of endogenous substrate
    (epi-isozizaene) with CYP170A1 (3.3 angstrom). The structure of the complex
    suggests that the proximal epi-isozizaene molecules may bind to the heme
    iron in two orientations. In addition, much to our surprise, we have found
    that albaflavenone synthase also has a second, completely distinct catalytic
    activity corresponding to the synthesis of farnesene isomers from farnesyl
    diphosphate. Within the cytochrome P450 alpha-helical domain both the
    primary sequence and x-ray structure indicate the presence of a novel
    terpene synthase active site that is moonlighting on the P450 structure.
    This includes signature sequences for divalent cation binding and an
    alpha-helical barrel. This barrel is unusual because it consists of only
    four helices rather than six found in all other terpene synthases.
    Mutagenesis establishes that this barrel is essential for the terpene
    synthase activity of CYP170A1 but not for the monooxygenase activity. This
    is the first bifunctional P450 discovered to have another active site
    moonlighting on it and the first time a terpene synthase active site is
    found moonlighting on another protein.

    In most metazoans, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) are encoded by gene
    families, and are used to detoxify xenobiotics. We describe the structure of
    genomic loci coding for the GSTs in the housefly that have been implicated,
    by both genetic and biochemical means, in mediating insecticide resistance.
    In earlier work, we showed that one of the theta-class enzymes, MdGST-3, is
    overproduced in resistant flies and degrades certain insecticides. We used a
    fragment from a cDNA clone of MdGST-3 as a probe to screen a housefly
    genomic DNA bank in phage lambda. This probe detected multiple gst loci.
    Genes for GSTs were found in five different, nonoverlapping lambda clones,
    three of which carry multiple, closely linked gsts. Multiple genes for both
    MdGST-3 and MdGST-4 were found; some of which have introns in their 5'
    untranslated regions. In adults, the only MdGST-3 enzymes that are expressed
    are encoded by the intron-free genes. A new theta-class GST (called MdGST-5)
    was also discovered. Fusion genes comprising 5' MdGST-3 sequences and either
    MdGST-4 or MdGST-5 sequences in their 3' halves were encountered at three
    separate loci. The genes described here are found in both the ancestral
    sensitive strain and the insecticide-resistant strains.

    BACKGROUND: Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) causes severe losses in many crops
    including cotton. Cytochrome P450s play crucial roles in the metabolism of
    many important compounds in various organisms. The authors attempt to
    identify new cytochrome P450 genes and investigate their expression profile
    and xenobiotic response in order to understand the nature and roles of
    cytochrome P450s in this important pest.RESULTS: A novel P450 cDNA
    (CYP9A17), encoding a protein of 531 amino acid residues, was isolated from
    H. armigera. CYP9A17 is a typical microsomal P450, showing the highest
    (93.9%) amino acid identity with CYP9A12 from H. armigera. The high
    similarity is not only found between cDNAs, but also between the intron-exon
    organisation. CYP9A12 is constitutively universally expressed in all four
    life stages and in all tested larval tissues, whereas CYP9A17 is
    specifically expressed in the larval midgut and fat body. Real-time
    quantitative RT-PCR showed that the level of both CYP9A12 and CYP9A17 mRNA
    is affected in dose-dependent and tissue-specific manners by deltamethrin,
    gossypol and phenobarbital.CONCLUSION: CYP9A12 and CYP9A17 showed high
    sequence identity, but with differential expression patterns, suggesting
    that CYP9A12 and CYP9A17 genes in H. armigera might diverge via
    subfunctionalisation after the gene duplication event. (C) 2009 Society of

    The mitochondrial genome of the German wasp Vespula germanica (Fabricius,
    1793) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) (GenBank accession no. KR703583) was sequenced
    in the study. It represents the first mitochondrial genome from the genus
    Vespula. There are totally 163 42 bp in the currently sequenced portion of
    the genome, containing 13 protein-coding, two rRNA, and 18 tRNA genes and a
    partial A + T-rich region. Four tRNA genes of trnI, trnQ, trnM and trnY
    located at the downstream of the A + T-rich region were failed to sequence.
    At least two rearrangement events occurred in the sequenced region compared
    with the pupative ancestral arrangement of insects, corresponding to the
    translocation or remote inversion of tnnY from trnW-trnC-trnY cluster to the
    region of trnI-trnQ-trnM cluster and translocation of trnL1 from the
    downstream to the upstream of nad1 gene. All protein-coding genes start with
    ATN codons. Twelve and one protein-coding genes stop with termination codon
    TAA and T, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis using the Bayesian method
    based on all codon positions of the 13 protein-coding genes supports the
    monophyly of Vespidae and Formicidae. Within the Formicidae, the Myrmicinae
    and Formicinae form a sister group and then sister to the Dolichoderinae,
    while within the Vespidae, the Eumeninae sister to the lineage of Vespinae +
    Polistinae.

    Our understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that mediate
    chemoreception in insects has been greatly improved after the discovery of
    olfactory and taste receptor proteins. However, after 50 years of the
    discovery of first insect sex pheromone from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, it is
    still unclear how hydrophobic compounds reach the dendrites of sensory
    neurons in vivo across aqueous space and interact with the sensory
    receptors. The presence of soluble polypeptides in high concentration in the
    lymph of chemosensilla still poses unanswered questions. More than two
    decades after their discovery and despite the wealth of structural and
    biochemical information available, the physiological function of
    odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) is not well understood. Here, I review the
    structural properties of different subclasses of insect OBPs and their
    binding to pheromones and other small ligands. Finally, I discuss current
    ideas and models on the role of such proteins in insect chemoreception. (C)

    For most organisms, chemosensation is critical for survival and is mediated
    by large families of chemoreceptor proteins, whose expression must be tuned
    appropriately to changes in the chemical environment. We asked whether
    expression of chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome would be
    regulated independently; whether expression of certain chemoreceptor genes
    would be especially sensitive to environmental changes; whether groups of
    chemoreceptor genes undergo coordinated rexpression; and how plastic the
    expression of chemoreceptor genes is with regard to sex, development,
    reproductive state, and social context. To answer these questions we used
    Drosophila melanogaster, because its chemosensory systems are well
    characterized and both the genotype and environment can be controlled
    precisely. Using customized cDNA microarrays, we showed that chemoreceptor
    genes that are clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional
    regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression
    of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive
    state and social interactions. Furthermore, exposure of flies only to odor
    of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor
    genes. These genes are distinct from those that show transcriptional
    plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex
    members. We analyzed covariance in transcript abundance of chemosensory
    genes across all environmental conditions and found that they segregated
    into 20 relatively small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated
    transcripts. This finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory
    subgenome enables fine tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor
    repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental and
    physiological conditions.

    Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification is one of the most important
    mechanisms involved in insecticide resistance. However, the molecular basis
    of this mechanism and the physiological functions of P450s associated with
    insecticide resistance remain largely unknown. Here, we exploited the
    functional genomics and reverse genetic approaches to identify and
    characterize a P450 gene responsible for the majority of deltamethrin
    resistance observed in the QTC279 strain of Tribolium castaneum. We used
    recently completed whole-genome sequence of T. castaneum to prepare custom
    microarrays and identified a P450 gene, CYP6BQ9, which showed more than a
    200-fold higher expression in the deltamethrin-resistant QTC279 strain when
    compared with its expression in the deltamethrin-susceptible Lab-S strain.
    Functional studies using both double-strand RNA (dsRNA)-mediated knockdown
    in the expression of CYP6BQ9 and transgenic expression of CYP6BQ9 in
    Drosophila melanogaster showed that CYP6BQ9 confers deltamethrin resistance.
    Furthermore, CYP6BQ9 enzyme expressed in baculovirus metabolizes
    deltamethrin to 4-hydroxy deltamethrin. Strikingly, we also found that
    unlike many P450 genes involved in insecticide resistance that were reported
    previously, CYP6BQ9 is predominantly expressed in the brain, a part of the
    central nervous system (CNS) containing voltage-gated sodium channels
    targeted by deltamethrin. Taken together, the current studies on the
    brain-specific insect P450 involved in deltamethrin resistance shed new
    light on the understanding of the molecular basis and evolution of
    insecticide resistance.

    Three cDNAs, cloned from both pyrethroid-susceptible and -resistant strains
    of Lygus lineolaris , contained a 1548 nucleotide open reading frame
    encoding a 516 amino acid residue protein. Predicted cytochrome P450s from
    cDNAs were classified as the first three new members of subfamily CYP6X,
    CYP6X1v1 for a susceptible strain and CYP6X1v2 and CYP6X1v3 for two
    resistant strains. Putative cytochrome P450 CYP6X1s from L. lineolaris were
    highly similar (up to 42% amino acid sequence identity) to several insect
    CYP6s that are responsible for reduced sensitivity to pyrethroid
    insecticides. A total of twenty-six nucleotide substitutions were revealed
    between cDNAs of susceptible and resistant strains. Two nucleotide
    substitutions resulted in amino acid changes, Asp(373) to Ala(373) and
    Ser(487) to Ala(487) , between susceptible and resistant strains. The
    resistant laboratory strain contained 2.1-fold higher cytochrome P450 mRNA
    per microgram total RNA than the susceptible laboratory strain. Topical
    treatment with 10 ng permethrin elevated cytochrome P450 mRNA levels by
    approximately 2-fold. The results of this study indicated that cytochrome
    P450 gene mutation, coupled with up-regulation, was present only in the
    pyrethroid resistant strains, and was possibly related to resistance
    development in the tarnished plant bug.

    BACKGROUND:The genetics of spikelet formation, a feature unique to grasses
    such as rice and maize, is yet to be fully understood, although a number of
    meristem and organ identity mutants have been isolated and investigated in
    Arabidopsis and maize. Using a two-element Ac/Ds transposon tagging system
    we have isolated a rice mutant, designated branched floretless 1 (bfl1)
    which is defective in the transition from spikelet meristem to floret
    meristem. RESULTS:The bfl1 mutant shows normal differentiation of the
    primary rachis-branches leading to initial spikelet meristem (bract-like
    structure equivalent to rudimentary glumes) formation but fails to develop
    empty glumes and florets. Instead, axillary meristems in the bract-like
    structure produce sequential alternate branching, thus resulting in a coral
    shaped morphology of the branches in the developing panicle. The bfl1 mutant
    harbours a single Ds insertion in the upstream region of the BFL1 gene on
    chromosome 7 corresponding to PAC clone P0625E02 (GenBank Acc No. message
    URL
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=nucleotide&list_uids=34395191&dopt=GenBank&term=ap004570AP004570).
    RT-PCR analyses revealed a drastic reduction of BFL1 transcript levels in
    the bfl1 mutant compared to that in the wild-type. In each of the normal
    panicle-bearing progeny plants, from occasional revertant seeds of the
    vegetatively-propagated mutant plant, Ds was shown to be excised from the
    bfl1 locus. BFL1 contains an EREBP/AP2 domain and is most likely an ortholog
    of the maize transcription factor gene BRANCHED SILKLESS1 (BD1).
    CONCLUSIONS:bfl1 is a Ds-tagged rice mutant defective in the transition from
    spikelet meristem (SM) to floret meristem (FM). BFL1 is most probably a rice
    ortholog of the maize ERF (EREBP/AP2) transcription factor gene BD1. Based
    on the similarities in mutant phenotypes bfl1 is likely to be an allele of
    the previously reported frizzy panicle locus.

    Rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence (panicle) architecture is an important
    agronomic trait for rice breeding. A number of high-yielding japonica rice
    strains, characterized by an erect panicle (EP) of their architecture, have
    been released as commercial varieties in China. But no EP-type indica
    varieties are released so far. Here, we identified two allelic erect-panicle
    mutants in indica rice, erect panicle2-1 (ep2-1) and erect panicle2-2
    (ep2-2), exhibiting the characteristic erect panicle phenotype. Both mutants
    were derived from spontaneous mutation. We cloned the EP2 gene by way of a
    map-based cloning strategy, and a transgenic complementation test rescued
    the phenotype of ep2-1. Anatomical investigations revealed that the ep2
    mutants have more vascular bundles and a thicker stem than that of wild-type
    plants, explaining the panicle erectness phenotype in ep2 mutants. It was
    shown that EP2 was specifically expressed in the vascular bundles of
    internodes by GUS staining and RT-PCR. EP2 encodes a novel plant-specific
    protein, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum with unknown
    biochemical function. In addition, EP2 also regulates other panicle
    characteristics, such as panicle length and grain size, but grain number per
    panicle shows little change, indicating that the mutation of the ep2 gene
    could be applied in EP-type indica rice breeding.

    The yield potential of rice (Oryza sativa L.) has experienced two
    significant growth periods that coincide with the introduction of
    semi-dwarfism and the utilization of heterosis. In present study, we
    determined the annual increase in the grain yield of rice varieties grown
    from 1936 to 2005 in Middle Reaches of Yangtze River and examined the
    contributions of RUE (radiation-use efficiency, the conversion efficiency of
    pre-anthesis intercepted global radiation to biomass) and NUE (nitrogen-use
    efficiency, the ratio of grain yield to aboveground N accumulation) to these
    improvements. An examination of the 70-year period showed that the annual
    gains of 61.9 and 75.3 kg ha(-1) in 2013 and 2014, respectively,
    corresponded to an annual increase of 1.18 and 1.16% in grain yields,
    respectively. The improvements in grain yield resulted from increases in the
    harvest index and biomass, and the sink size (spikelets per panicle) was
    significantly enlarged because of breeding for larger panicles. Improvements
    were observed in RUE and NUE through advancements in breeding. Moreover,
    both RUE and NUE were significantly correlated with the grain yield. Thus,
    our study suggests that genetic improvements in rice grain yield are
    associated with increased RUE and NUE.

    Background NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) plays a central role in
    cytochrome P450 action. The genes coding for P450s are not yet fully
    identified in the bed bug, Cimex lectularius. Hence, we decided to clone
    cDNA and knockdown the expression of the gene coding for CPR which is
    suggested to be required for the function of all P450s to determine whether
    or not P450s are involved in resistance of bed bugs to insecticides.  
    Methodology/Principal Findings The full length Cimex lectularius CPR (ClCPR)
    cDNA was isolated from a deltamethrin resistant bed bug population (CIN-1)
    using a combined PCR strategy. Bioinformatics and in silico modeling were
    employed to identify three conserved binding domains (FMN, FAD, NADP), a FAD
    binding motif, and the catalytic residues. The critical amino acids involved
    in FMN, FAD, NADP binding and their putative functions were also analyzed.
    No signal peptide but a membrane anchor domain with 21 amino acids which
    facilitates the localization of ClCPR on the endoplasmic reticulum was
    identified in ClCPR protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ClCPR is
    closer to the CPR from the body louse, Pediculus humanus corporis than to
    the CPRs from the other insect species studied. The ClCPR gene was
    ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested but showed an increase in
    expression as immature stages develop into adults. We exploited the
    traumatic insemination mechanism of bed bugs to inject dsRNA and
    successfully knockdown the expression of the gene coding for ClCPR.
    Suppression of the ClCPR expression increased susceptibility to deltamethrin
    in resistant populations but not in the susceptible population of bed
    bugs.   Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that P450-mediated
    metabolic detoxification may serve as one of the resistance mechanisms in
    bed bugs.

    The spreadsheet software Microsoft Excel, when used with default settings,
    is known to convert gene names to dates and floating-point numbers. A
    programmatic scan of leading genomics journals reveals that approximately
    one-fifth of papers with supplementary Excel gene lists contain erroneous
    gene name conversions.

    Orthologs generally are under selective pressure against loss of function,
    while paralogs usually accumulate mutations and finally die or deviate in
    terms of function or regulation. Most ortholog detection methods contaminate
    the resulting datasets with a substantial amount of paralogs. Therefore we
    aimed to implement a straightforward method that allows the detection of
    ortholog clusters with a reduced amount of paralogs from completely
    sequenced genomes. The described cross-species expansion of the reciprocal
    best BLAST hit method is a time-effective method for ortholog detection,
    which results in 68% truly orthologous clusters and the procedure
    specifically enriches single-copy orthologs. The detection of true orthologs
    can provide a phylogenetic toolkit to better understand evolutionary
    processes. In a study across six photosynthetic eukaryotes, nuclear genes of
    putative mitochondrial origin were shown to be over-represented among single
    copy orthologs. These orthologs are involved in fundamental biological
    processes like amino acid metabolism or translation. Molecular clock
    analyses based on this dataset yielded divergence time estimates for the
    red/green algae (1,142 MYA), green algae/land plant (725 MYA), mosses/seed
    plant (496 MYA), gymno-/angiosperm (385 MYA) and monocotyledons/core
    eudicotyledons (301 MYA) divergence times.

    The pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.) is widespread throughout much of
    Europe where it is a major coleopteran pest of oilseed rape (Brassica
    napus). The reliance on synthetic insecticides for control, particularly the
    pyrethroid class, has led to the development of populations with high levels
    of resistance. Resistance to pyrethroids is now widespread throughout Europe
    and is thought to be mediated by enhanced detoxification by cytochrome P450ś
    and/or mutation of the pyrethroid target-site, the voltage-gated sodium
    channel. However, in the case of cytochrome P450 mediated detoxification,
    the specific enzyme(s) involved has (have) not yet been identified. In this
    study a degenerate PCR approach was used to identify ten partial P450 gene
    sequences from pollen beetle. Quantitative PCR was then used to examine the
    level of expression of these genes in a range of pollen beetle populations
    that showed differing levels of resistance to pyrethroids in bioassays. The
    study revealed a single P450 gene, CYP6BQ23, which is significantly and
    highly overexpressed (up to ∼900-fold) in adults and larvae of pyrethroid
    resistant strains compared to susceptible strains. CYP6BQ23 overexpression
    is significantly correlated with both the level of resistance and with the
    rate of deltamethrin metabolism in microsomal preparations of these
    populations. Functional recombinant expression of full length CYP6BQ23 along
    with cytochrome P450 reductase in an insect (Sf9) cell line showed that it
    is able to efficiently metabolise deltamethrin to 4-hydroxy deltamethrin.
    Furthermore we demonstrated by detection of 4-hydroxy tau-fluvalinate using
    ESI-TOF MS/MS that functionally expressed CYP6BQ23 also metabolizes
    tau-fluvalinate. A protein model was generated and subsequent docking
    simulations revealed the predicted substrate-binding mode of both
    deltamethrin and tau-fluvalinate to CYP6BQ23. Taken together these results
    strongly suggest that the overexpression of CYP6BQ23 is the primary
    mechanism conferring pyrethroid resistance in pollen beetle populations
    throughout much of Europe. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

    Cabbage stem flea beetle, Psylliodes chrysocephala L. (Coleoptera:
    Chrysomelidae) is a major pest of winter oilseed rape in several European
    countries particularly attacking young emerging plants in autumn. Over the
    last several decades, pyrethroid insecticides have been foliarly applied to
    control flea beetle outbreaks. Recent control failures in northern Germany
    suggested pyrethroid resistance development in cabbage stem flea beetles,
    which were confirmed by resistance monitoring bioassays using
    lambda-cyhalothrin in an adult vial test. The purpose of this study was to
    investigate the presence of polymorphisms in the para-type voltage-gated
    sodium channel gene of P. chrysocephala known to be involved in knock-down
    resistance (kdr). By using a degenerate primer approach we PCR amplified
    part of the para-type sodium channel gene and identified in resistant flea
    beetles a single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in an L1014F (kdr)
    mutation within domain IIS6 of the channel protein, known as one of the
    chief pyrethroid target-site resistance mechanisms in several other pest
    insects. Twenty populations including four archived museum samples collected
    between 1945 and 1958 were analyzed using a newly developed pyrosequencing
    diagnostic assay. The assay revealed a kdr allele frequency of 90-100% in
    those flea beetle populations expressing high-level cross-resistance in
    discriminating dose bioassays against different pyrethroids such as
    lambda-cyhalothrin, tau-fluvalinate, etofenprox and bifenthrin. The presence
    of target-site resistance to pyrethroids in cabbage stem flea beetle is
    extremely worrying considering the lack of effective alternative modes of
    action to control this pest in Germany and other European countries, and is
    likely to result in major control problems once it expands to other
    geographies. The striking fact that cabbage stem flea beetle is next to
    pollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus the second coleopteran pest in European
    winter oilseed rape resisting pyrethroid treatments by expressing a
    target-site mutation, underpins the importance of diversity in available
    chemistry for resistance management tactics based on mode of action rotation
    in order to guarantee sustainable winter oilseed rape cultivation in Europe.

    We have identified genes regulated by starvation and sugar signals in
    Drosophila larvae using whole-genome microarrays. Based on expression
    profiles in the two nutrient conditions, they were organized into different
    categories that reflect distinct physiological pathways mediating sugar and
    fat metabolism, and cell growth. In the category of genes regulated in
    sugar-fed, but not in starved, animals, there is an upregulation of genes
    encoding key enzymes of the fat biosynthesis pathway and a downregulation of
    genes encoding lipases. The highest and earliest activated gene upon sugar
    ingestion is sugarbabe, a zinc finger protein that is induced in the gut and
    the fat body. Identification of potential targets using microarrays suggests
    that sugarbabe functions to repress genes involved in dietary fat breakdown
    and absorption. The current analysis provides a basis for studying the
    genetic mechanisms underlying nutrient signalling.

    This protocol describes how to appropriately design a genetic association
    case-control study, either focusing on a candidate gene (CG) or region or
    implementing a genome-wide approach. The steps described involve: (i)
    defining the case phenotype in adequate detail; (ii) checking the
    heritability of the disease in question; (iii) considering whether a
    population-based study is the appropriate design for the research question;
    (iv) the appropriate selection of controls; (v) sample size calculations and
    (vi) giving due consideration to whether it is a de novo or replication
    study. General guidelines are given, as well as specific examples of a CG
    and a genome-wide association study into type 2 diabetes. Software and
    websites used in this protocol include the International HapMap Consortium
    website, Genetic Power Calculator, CaT, and SNPSpD. Running each of the
    programs takes only a few seconds; the rate-limiting steps involve thinking
    through the designs and parameters in the disease models.

    Aging is a universal but poorly understood biological process. Free radicals
    accumulate with age and have been proposed to be a major cause of aging. We
    measured genome-wide changes in transcript levels as a function of age in
    Drosophila melanogaster and compared these changes with those caused by
    paraquat, a free-radical generator. A number of genes exhibited changes in
    transcript levels with both age and paraquat treatment. We also found genes
    whose transcript levels changed with age but not with paraquat treatment
    This study suggests that free radicals play an important role in regulating
    transcript levels in aging but that they are not the only factors. This
    genome-wide survey also identifies candidates for molecular markers of
    aging.
