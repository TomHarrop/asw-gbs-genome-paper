## Abstract

<!-- context and need for the work -->
Modified, agricultural landscapes are susceptible to damage by insect pests.
Biological control of pests is typically successful once the control agent is established, but this depends on its ability to adapt to evolution in the host.
Theoretical studies have shown that unequal genetic variation between the host and the control agent will lead to rapid evolution of resistance in the host, but cases of this have not been documented in the field.

<!-- - approach and methods used -->

To address this, we measured the genetic variation in New Zealand populations of the pasture pest, Argentine stem weevil (*Listronotus bonariensis*), which is controlled with declining effectiveness by a parasitoid wasp, *Microctonus hyperodae*.
We constructed a draft reference genome, then collected samples from a geographical survey of 10 sites around New Zealand and genotyped them using a modified genotyping-by-sequencing approach.

<!-- - main results (2-3 points) -->

New Zealand populations of Argentine stem weevil have high levels of heterozygosity and low structure, consistent with a large effective population size and frequent gene flow.
This implies that Argentine stem weevils were able to evolve more rapidly than its biocontrol agent, which reproduces asexually. 
These findings show that monitoring genetic diversity in biocontrol agents and their targets is critical for long-term success of biological control.
