Dear Dr. Perera,

We would like our manuscript, 'Genetic diversity in invasive populations of Argentine stem weevil allows adaptation to biocontrol', to be considered for inclusion in the Population Genetics issue of *Insects*.

Our work provides a crucial piece of evidence to explain the how the exotic population of Argentine stem weevil in New Zealand has become resistant to a once-effective, introduced biological control agent.
This topic remains of broad interest, because this is the only documented case of evolved resistance to biocontrol in the literature.
Previous work on this system, using traditional molecular markers, had concluded that genetic diversity was almost non-existent the weevil.
However, using genome-wide genotyping, we have now shown that the level of heterozygosity in these populations is actually much higher than suggested.
Taken with the fact that the biological control agent reproduces asexually, we now see this as further evidence that the evolution of resistance in Argentine stem weevil has been a result of an unequal evolutionary arms race between the parasitoid and its host.

Our models of the demographic history of weevil populations in New Zealand support repeated and/or large incursions, possibly via more than one route of entry.
We also detected a latitudinal cline in genetic variation and evidence for a minor geographical barrier restricting migration between populations.
Despite this, we found that most of the genetic variance between populations is unstructured, suggesting gene flow and a large effective population size across New Zealand.
These findings have implications for the management of resistance in these populations, as we have found that there is large amount of standing variation for selection to act upon, and beneficial variants can spread between populations.

Yours sincerely,

Thomas Harrop, on behalf of the authors.
