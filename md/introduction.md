## Introduction

Biological control of pests via the release of specialist natural predators can provide continued, self-sustaining, non-polluting and inexpensive management.
Although the estimated chance of establishment of biocontrol programs is low [@gurrHistoryMethodologicalTheoretical2000], biocontrol agents maintain their efficacy once established [@holtWhenBiologicalControl1997], partly because the agent can evolve adaptations to counter adaptations in the host [e.g. @pastoretBiologicalControlVertebrate2000; @livelyParasiteAdaptationLocally2000].

A biocontrol system has been in use since the 1990s to manage a destructive, invasive pest of New Zealand pastures, the Argentine stem weevil (ASW; *Listronotus bonariensis* Kuschel; Coleoptera: Curculionidae).
New Zealand pastures are highly modified landscapes that suffer severe pest impacts [@fergusonQuantifyingEconomicCost2019].
The susceptibility of pasture to pests may be due to low plant and animal diversity, resulting in low biotic resistance to invasive species [@goldsonSevereInsectPest2020a].
In New Zealand, ASW reaches densities of 700 adults per square metre and causes economic impacts up to NZ$200M per annum [@barkerArgentineStemWeevil1993; @prestidgeEconomicCostArgentine1991; @fergusonQuantifyingEconomicCost2019].
Conventional chemical control of ASW is ineffective, environmentally damaging and uneconomical [@goldsonImportationQuarantineMicroctonus1990; @barlowAlienInvertebratesNew2002a], because the stem-mining larvae avoid direct contact with the pesticides [@goldsonImportationQuarantineMicroctonus1990].
To complement endophyte-based plant resistance [@johnsonExploitationEpichloaeEndophytes2013; @kauppinenEpichloeGrassEndophytes2016], the solitary wasp *Microctonus hyperodae* Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was released for biological control of ASW in 1992.
Within three years of its release, parasitism of ASW by *M. hyperodae* reached 90% [@barkerEarlyImpactEndoparasitoid2006], reducing or eliminating damage by ASW [*e.g.* @barkerEarlyImpactEndoparasitoid2006; @goldsonArgentineStemWeevil2011; @barkerBiologyIntroducedBiocontrol2013].

Although ASW was initially well managed by *M. hyperodae*, suppression of the weevil by *M. hyperodae* began to fail after about 14 generations [@popayCurrentStatusArgentine2011; @goldsonApparentAcquiredResistance2016; @tomasettoIntensifiedAgricultureFavors2017].
This loss of efficacy may be the result of adaptation in weevil populations resulting from selection pressure by the parasitoid [@goldsonApparentAcquiredResistance2016; @tomasettoIntensifiedAgricultureFavors2017].
Because ASW reproduces sexually, ASW populations may have greater capacity to evolve than populations of *M. hyperodae*, which reproduces parthenogenetically.
Empirical modelling of the ASW--*M. hyperodae* interaction indicated that resistance is inevitable when hosts have more genetic variation than their predator [@casanovasAsymmetryReproductionStrategies2018].
Despite this theoretical pathway for resistance, other examples of evolution of resistance to classical biological control have not been reported [@pennisiFirstNaturalSelection2017], and population-level studies of genetic variation in host and parasitoid are required to explain the evolution of resistance in this case.

We address this with genotyping-by-sequencing of a geographical survey of Argentine stem weevil populations distributed across New Zealand.
Our experiments revealed a repetitive genome with high heterozygosity and a high proportion of unstructured variation across 10 populations from the North and South islands of New Zealand, consistent with large effective population size and gene flow between populations.
Genetic variation found along a latitudinal cline was associated with signatures of selection in regions of the genome, indicating a level of local adaptation within populations, but we found no evidence at this resolution of genetic adaptation in parasitised weevils compared to parasitoid-free weevils.
Our results showed that the amount of genetic variation in New Zealand populations of ASW is far greater than detected by traditional molecular markers [@williamsGeographicalOriginIntroduced1994; @vinkPCRGutAnalysis2013], implying that ASW populations have evolved resistance via weak selection acting on variants of minor effect that existed before the introduction of *M. hyperodae*.
