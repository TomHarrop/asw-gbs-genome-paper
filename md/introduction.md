## Introduction

New Zealand pastures are highly modified landscapes that suffer from severe pest impacts [@fergusonQuantifyingEconomicCost2019].
The susceptibility of pasture to pests may be due to low plant and animal diversity, resulting in low biotic resistance to invasive species [@goldsonSevereInsectPest2020].
The Argentine stem weevil (ASW), *Listronotus bonariensis* Kuschel, is a particularly destructive invasive pest of pasture, reaching densities of 700 adults per m2 and causing economic impacts up to NZ$200M per annum [@barkerArgentineStemWeevil1993; @prestidgeEconomicCostArgentine1991; @fergusonQuantifyingEconomicCost2019].
Conventional, chemical control of ASW is not possible because **xyz** (**ref**).
To complement endophyte-based plant resisance [@johnsonExploitationEpichloaeEndophytes2013; @kauppinenEpichloeGrassEndophytes2016], the solitary wasp *Microctonus hyperodae* Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was released for biological control of *L. bonariensis* in 1992.
Within three years of its release, parasitism of ASW by *M. hyperodae* reached 90% [@barkerEarlyImpactEndoparasitoid2006], reducing or eliminating damage by ASW [*e.g.* @barkerEarlyImpactEndoparasitoid2006; @goldsonArgentineStemWeevil2011; @barkerBiologyIntroducedBiocontrol2013].
Once established, failure of biological control is **rare/unprecedented?**, because **xyz** (**ref**).

Although ASW was initially well managed by this system, biological control of ASW by *M. hyperodae* failed after c.14 generations [@popayCurrentStatusArgentine2011; @goldsonApparentAcquiredResistance2016; @tomasettoIntensifiedAgricultureFavors2017].
This failure may be the result of adaptation in weevil populations resulting from selection pressure by the parasitoid [@goldsonApparentAcquiredResistance2016; @tomasettoIntensifiedAgricultureFavors2017].
Because ASW reproduces sexually, ASW populations may have greater capacity to evolve than populations of *M. hyperodae*, which reproduces parthenogenetically.
Empirical modelling of the ASW--*M. hyperodae* interaction indicated that resistance is inevitable when hosts have more genetic variation than their predator [@casanovasAsymmetryReproductionStrategies2018], *e.g.* because of genetic recombination.
Although this work establishes a theoretical pathway for resistance to occur, examples of evolution of resistance to classical biological control have not been reported (**are we sure?**).

Measuring the variation in populations of the host and the parasitoid is required to explain this case of evolution of resistance to biocontrol.
We address this by genotyping-by-sequencing of a geographical survey of Argentine stem weevil populations in New Zealand.
Our experiments reveal a high proportion of unstructured variation across 12 populations from the North and Sourth islands of New Zealand, consistent with high heterozygosity and gene flow between populations.
We found a geographical cline associated with regions of the genome, indicating a level of local adaptation within populations, but no evidence of adaptation at this resolution in parasitised weevils compared to parasitoid-free weevils.
Our results show that the amount of genetic variation in NZ populations of ASW is far higher than detected by traditional molecular markers [@williamsGeographicalOriginIntroduced1994; @vinkPCRGutAnalysis2013],, suggesting that ASW populations evolved resistance via weak selection acting on variants of minor effect that existed before the introduction of *M. hyperodae*.
