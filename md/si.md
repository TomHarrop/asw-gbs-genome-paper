**Supplementary Figure 1**.
*k*-mer analysis of the short read sequencing dataset at $k=31$.
**A** *k*-mer distribution in the short read dataset before and after normalisation.
The peak at 84--216× coverage (highlighted in green) suggests a diploid genome with a haploid size of 967 Mb.
The haploid peak (22--56× coverage) indicates a high number of polymorphic sites in the single, male individual used to generate this dataset.
BBTools [@bushnellBBMapFastAccurate2014] estimated 2.1 polymorphisms per 100 bp in this dataset.
**B** Cumulative percentage of all *k*-mers *vs.* frequency.
72% of all *k*-mers are at 216× or less coverage, indicating that the remaining 28% of *k*-mers are repetitive.
The earlier inflexion point at 48% suggests that *k*-mers in the region from 48--72% may also be from repetitive regions.
