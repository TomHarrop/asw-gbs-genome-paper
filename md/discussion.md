## Discussion

The purpose of this work was to investigate the relationship between genetic variation and resistance to biocontrol in New Zealand populations of Argentine stem weevil.
Previous reports using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and *cytochrome C oxidase subunit I* (*COI*) sequencing suggested a high degree of genetic similarity and identified a single *COI* haplotype in New Zealand populations [@williamsGeographicalOriginIntroduced1994; @vinkPCRGutAnalysis2013].
In contrast, our results from a genome-wide genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) approach reveal a high level of genetic diversity within and between populations.
We suggest that this standing variation provides an evolutionary advantage to ASW populations in comparison to their biocontrol agent, which we expect to be exacerbated by asexual reproduction in *M. hyperodae*.
This indicates that genetic variation in both host and target need to be monitored with high-resolution genotyping to maintain success of biological control.

**Para on demographics goes here (or not)**.

Despite the increased resolution of GBS compared to traditional markers, we did not detect regions of the genome associated with parasitism by *M. hyperodae*.
Resistance to biocontrol may not be genetic, or manual detection of the parasitoid may not be a strong enough phenotype to separate resistant and susceptible individuals.
We suggest that resistance to *M. hyperodae* is encoded by multiple regions of small effect, selected from the high amount of standing variation we detected in ASW populations.
A polygenic response on standing variation is consistent with the low level of selection by the biocontrol agent [@mckenzieGeneticMolecularPhenotypic1994; @greenCisTransactingVariants2019].
The number of markers yielded by legacy genotyping-by-sequencing approaches provides low power to detect polygenic responses resulting from weak selection on standing variation.
Higher-resolution, genome-wide association studies using whole-genome resequencing with more individuals and a stronger resistance phenotype may allow detection of regions of the genome associated with resistance of the weevils to biocontrol.

Two draft weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) genomes constructed from short reads have been deposited in the NCBI database.
The coffee berry borer, *Hypothenemus hampei*, has a draft genome size of 163 MB [@vegaDraftGenomeMost2015], and the mountain pine beetle, *Dendroctonus ponderosae*, has a draft genome size of 202 MB in males and 213 MB in females [@keelingDraftGenomeMountain2013].
Draft genomes incorprating long reads have been deposited for the red palm weevil (*Rhynchophorus ferrugineus*; [GCA_012979105.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_012979105.1/)) and the rice weevil (*Sitophilus oryzae*; [GCF_002938485.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_002938485.1/)).
The long-read genomes are 782 MB and 771 MB, respectively, suggesting that long-read assemblies capture more of the genome, presumably because longer repeat regions can be assembled.
Our final genome  of 1.1 GB is larger than other available weevil genomes, although it is draft quality and we expect gaps in the assembly at larger repeat regions that were not sufficiently covered by long reads.
Short-read genome assembly was not effective for this species because of the extreme repeat content.
Our final draft assembly had a repeat content of **67.8%** (Table 1), with a maximum repeat size of 17.7 kb and a repeat *N*~50~ length of 485 bp.
The non-repetitive regions had an *N*~50~ length of 1066 bp.
The heterozygosity in weevil populations and lack of an inbred, laboratory strain made pooling individuals for sequencing undesirable.
The high number of multiple-copy genes in the combined, long read genome highlights the difficulty of assembling repetitive genomes from small, heterozygous organisms.
Our assembly strategy of contig construction with the longest reads, followed by assembly polishing with long reads from a single individual, and then redundant contig removal with PCR-free short reads from another single individual allowed us to improve the contiguity and completeness of the stem weevil genome whilst managing the number of redundant contigs (Table 1).

**Conclusion (let's see what demographics say)**
