# Genetic variation associated with a geographical cline in New Zealand populations of Argentine Stem Weevil

## Intro

Goldson to write

## Results

1. There is a large amount of variation in ASW populations in NZ (**Ruy/Tom/Marissa**)
    - Describe collections
    - Describe genotyping data
    - Diversity stats: amount of variation, heterozygosity etc

2. Draft genome (**Tom/Sarah**)
    - We generated a genome to map the variation
    - Initial assembly with Illumina data didn't work; kmer analysis suggested heterozygosity of xyz
    - Genome was contigged with a pool of many individuals and polished with a single individual
    - duplicate contigs were purged with purge_haplotigs using PCR-free Illumina reads from a single indiv
    - compare stats and BUSCO scores for the three genomes: single indiv, pooled + polished, pooled + polished + purged
    - The genome is nasty, but the assembly is OK
    - We can map SNPs on it
    - We are not including an annotation, it's too hard / currently not working; this can go in another paper later if we need it

3. The variation associates with a north-south cline (**Marissa/Tom**)
    - PCA + map
    - amount of structured variation
    - loci that mapped against the genome
    - what does it say about incursions / dispersion?

4. The variation does not associate with parasitism (**Marissa**)
    - Para vs. non-para genotypes (e.g. Manhattan plots)

5. Regions of the genome under selection (**Marissa/Rachael?**)
    - Evidence or speculation as to single/multiple introductions, constant incursions (**Marissa?**)
    - We presume there is selection to cause the north-south cline but could also be related to parasitism;
    - is there evidence of a selective sweep? (**Rachael?**)
